lyrics,artiste
Looking for some education,Adele
Made my way into the night,Adele
All that bullshit conversation,Adele
Baby can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details baby,Adele
I don't even wanna waste your time,Adele
Let's just say that maybe,Adele
You could help me ease my mind,Adele
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love,Adele
If that's love in your eyes,Adele
It's more than enough,Adele
Had some bad love,Adele
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh ooh,Adele
Ooh ooh Looking for some affirmation,Adele
Made my way into the sun,Adele
My friends got their ladies,Adele
And they're all having babies,Adele
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details baby,Adele
I don't even wanna waste your time,Adele
Let's just say that maybe,Adele
You could help me ease my mind,Adele
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love,Adele
If that's love in your eyes,Adele
It's more than enough,Adele
I've had some bad love,Adele
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh ooh,Adele
Baby baby,Adele
Ooh ooh,Adele
Baby baby,Adele
Ooh ooh,Adele
Baby baby,Adele
Ooh In the absence of security,Adele
I made my way into the night,Adele
Stupid cupid keeps on calling me,Adele
And I see nothing in his eyes,Adele

Oh I just want to make love to you Happy New Year! I heard that you're settled down,Adele
That you found a girl and you're married now,Adele
I heard that your dreams came true,Adele
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you Old friend why are you so shy?,Adele
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,Adele
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it,Adele
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded,Adele
That for me it isn't over Never mind I'll find someone like you,Adele
I wish nothing but the best for you two,Adele
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said,Adele
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,Adele
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead You know how the time flies,Adele
Only yesterday was the time of our lives,Adele
We were born and raised in a summer haze,Adele
Bound by the surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,Adele
But I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it,Adele
I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded,Adele
That for me it isn't over Never mind I'll find someone like you,Adele
I wish nothing but the best for you two,Adele
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said,Adele
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah Nothing compares no worries or cares,Adele
Regrets and mistakes they're memories made,Adele
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste? Never mind I'll find someone like you,Adele
I wish nothing but the best for you,Adele
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said,Adele
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead Never mind I'll find someone like you,Adele
I wish nothing but the best for you two,Adele
Don't forget me I beg I remember you said,Adele
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,Adele
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead There's a fire starting in my heart,Adele
Reaching a fever pitch it's bringing me out the dark,Adele
Finally I can see you crystal clear,Adele
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,Adele
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare,Adele
See how I leave with every piece of you,Adele
Don't underestimate the things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart,Adele
Reaching a fever pitch,Adele
And it's bringing me out the dark The scars of your love remind me of us,Adele
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,Adele
The scars of your love they leave me breathless,Adele
I can't help feeling,Adele
We could have had it all,Adele
Rolling in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
And you played it to the beat,Adele
But I've heard one on you,Adele
And I'm gonna make your head burn,Adele
Think of me in the depths of your despair,Adele
Make a home down there,Adele
The scars of your love remind me of us,Adele
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all,Adele
The scars of your love they leave me breathless,Adele
I can't help feeling,Adele
We could have had it all,Adele
Rolling in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
And you played it to the beat,Adele
We could have had it all,Adele
Rolling in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
We could have had it all,Adele
We could have had it all,Adele
It all it all it all,Adele
Rolling in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
And you played it to the beat,Adele
Rolling in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
You played it,Adele
You played it,Adele
You played it to the beat. Hello it's me,Adele
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet,Adele
To go over everything,Adele
They say that time's supposed to heal ya,Adele
But I ain't done much healing Hello can you hear me?,Adele
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be,Adele
When we were younger and free,Adele
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet There's such a difference between us,Adele
And a million miles Hello from the other side,Adele
I must've called a thousand times,Adele
To tell you I'm sorry,Adele
For everything that I've done,Adele
But when I call you never,Adele
Seem to be home Hello from the outside,Adele
At least I can say that I've tried,Adele
To tell you I'm sorry,Adele
For breaking your heart,Adele
But it don't matter it clearly,Adele
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Hello how are you?,Adele
It's so typical of me to talk about myself I'm sorry,Adele
I hope that you're well,Adele
Did you ever make it out of that town,Adele
Where nothing ever happened? It's no secret,Adele
That the both of us,Adele
To tell you I'm sorry,Adele
For everything that I've done,Adele
But when I call you never,Adele
To tell you I'm sorry,Adele
For breaking your heart,Adele
But it don't matter it clearly,Adele
Doesn't tear you apart anymore Oh anymore,Adele
Oh anymore,Adele
Oh anymore,Adele
To tell you I'm sorry,Adele
For everything that I've done,Adele
But when I call you never,Adele
To tell you I'm sorry,Adele
For breaking your heart,Adele
But it don't matter it clearly,Adele
Doesn't tear you apart anymore I will leave my heart at the door,Adele
I won't say a word,Adele
They've all been said before you know,Adele
So why don't we just play pretend,Adele
Like we're not scared of what's coming next,Adele
Or scared of having nothing left Look don't get me wrong,Adele
I know there is no tomorrow,Adele
All I ask is If this is my last night with you,Adele
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend,Adele
Give me a memory I can use,Adele
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do,Adele
It matters how this ends,Adele
'Cause what if I never love again? I don't need your honesty,Adele
It's already in your eyes,Adele
And I'm sure my eyes they speak for me,Adele
No one knows me like you do,Adele
And since you're the only one that matters,Adele
Tell me who do I run to? Look don't get me wrong,Adele
I know there is no tomorrow,Adele
All I ask is If this is my last night with you,Adele
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend,Adele
Give me a memory I can use,Adele
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do,Adele
It matters how this ends,Adele
'Cause what if I never love again? Let this be our lesson in love,Adele
Let this be the way we remember us,Adele
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious,Adele
And I ain't asking for forgiveness,Adele
All I ask is If this is my last night with you,Adele
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend,Adele
Give me a memory I can use,Adele
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do,Adele
It matters how this ends,Adele
Cause what if I never love again? I let it fall my heart,Adele
And as it fell you rose to claim it,Adele
It was dark and I was over,Adele
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong,Adele
But my knees were far too weak,Adele
To stand in your arms,Adele
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you that I never knew never knew,Adele
All the things you'd say they were never true never true,Adele
And the games you'd play you would always win always win But I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Let it burn while I cry,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name When laying with you,Adele
I could stay there close my eyes,Adele
Feel you here forever,Adele
You and me together nothing gets better Cause there's a side to you that I never knew never knew,Adele
All the things you'd say they were never true never true,Adele
And the games you'd play you would always win always win But I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Let it burn while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name I set fire to the rain,Adele
And I threw us into the flames,Adele
Where I felt something die 'cause I knew that,Adele
That was the last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,Adele
As if that heart you caught is still waiting for you,Adele
Even now when it's already over,Adele
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Let it burn while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name I set fire to the rain,Adele
And I threw us into the flames,Adele
Where I felt something die,Adele
Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time oh,Adele
Oh oh Let it burn oh,Adele
Let it burn,Adele
Let it burn Everybody loves the things you do,Adele
From the way you talk,Adele
To the way you move,Adele
Everybody here is watching you,Adele
'Cause you feel like home,Adele
You're like a dream come true,Adele
But if by chance you're here alone,Adele
Can I have a moment,Adele
Before I go?,Adele
'Cause I've been by myself all night long,Adele
Hoping you're someone I used to know You look like a movie,Adele
You sound like a song,Adele
My God this reminds me,Adele
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light,Adele
In case it is the last time,Adele
That we might be exactly like we were,Adele
Before we realized,Adele
We were sad of getting old,Adele
It made us restless,Adele
It was just like a movie,Adele
It was just like a song I was so scared to face my fears,Adele
Nobody told me that you'd be here,Adele
That's what you said when you left me You still look like a movie,Adele
You still sound like a song,Adele
My God this reminds me,Adele
Of when we were young Let me photograph you in this light,Adele
In case it is the last time,Adele
That we might be exactly like we were,Adele
Before we realized,Adele
We were sad of getting old,Adele
It made us restless,Adele
It was just like a movie,Adele
It was just like a song When we were young,Adele
When we were young,Adele
When we were young,Adele
When we were young It's hard to win me back,Adele
Everything just takes me back,Adele
To when you were there,Adele
To when you were there,Adele
And a part of me keeps holding on,Adele
Just in case it hasn't gone,Adele
I guess I still care,Adele
Do you still care? It was just like a movie,Adele
It was just like a song,Adele
My God this reminds me,Adele
Of when we were young When we were young,Adele
When we were young,Adele
When we were young,Adele
When we were young Let me photograph you in this light,Adele
In case it is the last time,Adele
That we might be exactly like we were,Adele
Before we realized,Adele
We were sad of getting old,Adele
It made us restless,Adele
Oh I'm so mad I'm getting old,Adele
It makes me reckless,Adele
It was just like a movie,Adele
It was just like a song,Adele
When we were young Whenever I'm alone with you,Adele
You make me feel like I am home again,Adele
Whenever I'm alone with you,Adele
You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you,Adele
You make me feel like I am young again,Adele
Whenever I'm alone with you,Adele
You make me feel like I am fun again However far away I will always love you,Adele
However long I stay I will always love you,Adele
Whatever words I say I will always love you,Adele
I will always love you Whenever I'm alone with you,Adele
You make me feel like I am free again,Adele
Whenever I'm alone with you,Adele
You make me feel like I am clean again However far away I will always love you,Adele
However long I stay I will always love you,Adele
Whatever words I say I will always love you,Adele

However long I stay I will always love you,Adele
Whatever words I say I will always love you,Adele
I will always love you,Adele
I will always love you,Adele
'Cause I love you When the rain is blowing in your face,Adele
And the whole world is on your case,Adele
I could offer you a warm embrace,Adele
To make you feel my love When the evening shadows and the stars appear,Adele
And there is no one there to dry your tears,Adele
I could hold you for a million years,Adele
To make you feel my love I know you haven't made your mind up yet,Adele
But I would never do you wrong,Adele
I've known it from the moment that we met,Adele
no doubt in my mind were you belong I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue,Adele
I'd go crawling down the avenue,Adele
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do,Adele
To make you feel my love The storms are raging on the rolling sea,Adele
And on the highway of regret,Adele
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,Adele
You ain't seen nothing like me yet I could make you happy make your dreams come true,Adele
Nothing that I wouldn't do,Adele
Go to the ends of the Earth for you,Adele
To make you feel my love To make you feel my love I've made up my mind,Adele
Don't need to think it over,Adele
If I'm wrong I am right,Adele
Don't need to look no further,Adele
This ain't lust,Adele
I know this is love but If I tell the world,Adele
I'll never say enough,Adele
Cause it was not said to you,Adele
And that's exactly what I need to do,Adele
If I'm in love with you Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere,Adele
Or would it be a waste?,Adele
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?,Adele
Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere I'd build myself up,Adele
And fly around in circles,Adele
Waiting as my heart drops,Adele
And my back begins to tingle,Adele
Finally could this be it or Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere,Adele
Or would it be a waste?,Adele
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?,Adele
Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere yeah Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere,Adele
Or would it be a waste?,Adele
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?,Adele
Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?,Adele
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere,Adele
Or would it be a waste?,Adele
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?,Adele
Should I give up,Adele
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?,Adele
Even if it leads nowhere When will I see you again?,Adele
You left with no goodbye not a single word was said,Adele
No final kiss to seal anything,Adele
I had no idea of the state we were in I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,Adele
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head,Adele
But don't you remember don't you remember?,Adele
The reason you loved me before,Adele
Baby please remember me once more When was the last time you thought of me?,Adele
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?,Adele
I often think about where I went wrong,Adele
The more I do the less I know But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,Adele
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head,Adele
But don't you remember don't you remember?,Adele
The reason you loved me before,Adele
Baby please remember me once more Oh I gave you the space so you could breathe,Adele

In hope that you find the missing piece,Adele
To bring you back to me Why don't you remember don't you remember?,Adele
The reason you loved me before,Adele
Baby please remember me once more,Adele
When will I see you again? She she ain't real,Adele

Learning to fly learning to run,Adele
I let my heart decide the way,Adele
When I was young,Adele
Deep down I must have always known,Adele
That this would be inevitable,Adele
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay,Adele
And bear my soul I know I'm not the only one,Adele
Who regrets the things they've done,Adele
Sometimes I just feel it's only me,Adele
Who can't stand the reflection that they see,Adele
I wish I could live a little more,Adele
Look up to the sky not just the floor,Adele
I feel like my life is flashing by,Adele
And all I can do is watch and cry,Adele
I miss the air I miss my friends,Adele
I miss my mother I miss it when,Adele
Life was a party to be thrown,Adele
But that was a million years ago When I walk around all of the streets,Adele
Where I grew up and found my feet,Adele
They can't look me in the eye,Adele
It's like they're scared of me,Adele
I try to think of things to say,Adele
Like a joke or a memory,Adele
But they don't recognize me now,Adele
In the light of day I know I'm not the only one,Adele
Who regrets the things they've done,Adele
Sometimes I just feel it's only me,Adele
Who never became who they thought they'd be,Adele
I wish I could live a little more,Adele
Look up to the sky not just the floor,Adele
I feel like my life is flashing by,Adele
And all I can do is watch and cry,Adele
I miss the air I miss my friends,Adele
I miss my mother I miss it when,Adele
Life was a party to be thrown,Adele
But that was a million years ago,Adele
A million years ago Looking for some education,Adele
Made my way into the night,Adele
All that bullshit conversation,Adele
Baby can't you read the signs? I won't bore you with the details baby,Adele
I don't even wanna waste your time,Adele
Let's just say that maybe,Adele
You could help me ease my mind,Adele
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love,Adele
If that's love in your eyes,Adele
It's more than enough,Adele
Had some bad love,Adele
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh ooh,Adele
Ooh ooh Looking for some affirmation,Adele
Made my way into the sun,Adele
My friends got their ladies,Adele
And they're all having babies,Adele
I just wanna have some fun I won't bore you with the details baby,Adele
I don't even wanna waste your time,Adele
Let's just say that maybe,Adele
You could help me ease my mind,Adele
I ain't Mr. Right But if you're looking for fast love,Adele

It's more than enough,Adele
I've had some bad love,Adele
So fast love is all that I've got on my mind Ooh ooh,Adele
Baby baby,Adele

Please stay where you are,Adele
Don't come any closer,Adele
Don't try to change my mind,Adele
I'm being cruel to be kind I can't love you in the dark,Adele
It feels like we're oceans apart,Adele
There is so much space between us,Adele
Maybe we're already defeated,Adele
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt,Adele
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine,Adele
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight,Adele
Please don't fall apart,Adele
I can't face your breaking heart,Adele
I'm trying to be brave,Adele
Stop asking me to stay I can't love you in the dark,Adele
It feels like we're oceans apart,Adele
There is so much space between us,Adele
Maybe we're already defeated,Adele
I don't regret a thing,Adele
Every word I've said,Adele

That you are in my life,Adele
But I want to live,Adele
And not just survive That's why I can't love you in the dark,Adele

Towards me from across the room,Adele
Brushing past my every groove,Adele

Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
And you played it to the beat,Adele
Could've had it all... Rollin' in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
Throw your stone through every open door,Adele
Count your blessings to find what you look for,Adele
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,Adele

It all It all It all... We could've had it all...,Adele
Rollin' in the deep...,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
And you played it to the beat,Adele
Could've had it all,Adele
Rollin' in the deep,Adele
You had my heart inside of your hand,Adele
But you played it you played it you played it you played it to the beat Some say I'll be better without you,Adele
They don't know you like I do,Adele
Or at least as far as I thought I knew,Adele
I can't bear this time,Adele
It drags as I lose my mind,Adele
Reminded by things I find,Adele
I know some clothes you left behind.,Adele
Wake me up wake me up when all is done,Adele
I won't rise until this battle's won,Adele
My dignity is become undone But I won't go,Adele
I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk,Adele
I won't go I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this is ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk So petrified I'm so scared to step into this right,Adele
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?,Adele
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying,Adele
I heard his voice today,Adele
I didn't know a single word he said,Adele
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met,Adele
Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won't go I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk,Adele
I won't go I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk There will be times we'll try and give it up,Adele
Bursting at the seams no doubt,Adele
We almost fall apart and burn up easy,Adele
So watch them turn to dust,Adele
But nothing will never taint us I won't go I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk,Adele
I won't go I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk Will he will he still remember me?,Adele
Will he still love me even when he's free,Adele
Or will he go back to the place where,Adele
He will choose the poison over me?,Adele
When we spoke yesterday,Adele
He said to hold my breath to sit and wait,Adele
I'll be home soon I won't be late He won't go,Adele
He can't do it on his own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
He's willing to take the risk,Adele
So I won't go I can't do it on his own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk 'Cause he won't go,Adele
He can't do it on his own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
We're willing to take the risk,Adele
I won't go! I can't do it on my own,Adele
If this ain't love then what is?,Adele
I'm willing to take the risk I let it fall my heart,Adele
And as it fell you rose to claim it,Adele
It was dark and I was over,Adele
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong,Adele
But my knees were far too weak,Adele
To stand in your arms,Adele
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you,Adele
That I never knew never knew,Adele
All the things you'd say,Adele
They were never true never true,Adele
And the games you play,Adele
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Well it burned while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,Adele
Your name When I lay with you,Adele
I could stay there,Adele
Close my eyes,Adele
Feel you here forever,Adele
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you,Adele
That I never knew never knew,Adele
All the things you'd say,Adele
They were never true never true,Adele
And the games you play,Adele
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Well it burned while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming out your name,Adele
Your name I set fire to the rain,Adele
And I threw us into the flames,Adele
Well it felt something died,Adele
'Cause I knew that that was,Adele
The last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,Adele
That heart you caught must be waiting for you,Adele
Even now when we're already over,Adele
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Well it burned while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,Adele
Your name I set fire to the rain,Adele
And I threw us into the flames,Adele
Well it felt something died,Adele
Cause I knew that that was the last time,Adele
The last time Let it burn,Adele
Let it burn,Adele
Let it burn Daydreamer,Adele
Sitting on the sea,Adele
Soaking up the sun,Adele
He is a real lover,Adele
And making up the past,Adele
Feeling up his girl,Adele
Like he's never felt a figure before A jaw dropper,Adele
Looks good when he walks,Adele
Is the subject of their talk,Adele
He would be hard to chase,Adele
But good to catch,Adele
And he could change the world,Adele
With his hands behind his back oh You can find him sittin' on your doorstep,Adele
Waiting for a surprise,Adele
And he will feel like he's been there for hours,Adele
And you can tell that he'll be there for life Daydreamer,Adele
With eyes that make you melt,Adele
He lends his coat for shelter,Adele
Plus he's there for you,Adele
When he shouldn't be,Adele
But he stays all the same,Adele
Waits for you,Adele
Then sees you through There's no way I,Adele
Could describe him,Adele
What I'll say is,Adele
Just what I'm hoping for But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep,Adele
Waiting for a surprise,Adele
And he will feel like he's been there for hours,Adele
And I can tell that he'll be there for life,Adele
And I can tell that he'll be there for life With your loving there ain't nothing,Adele
That I can't adore,Adele
The way I'm running with you honey,Adele
Is we can break every low,Adele
I find it funny that you're the only,Adele
One I never looked for,Adele
There is something in your loving,Adele
That tears down my walls I wasn't ready then I'm ready now,Adele
I'm heading straight for you,Adele
You will only be eternally,Adele
The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion,Adele

Devotion ,Adele
When did it go wrong I will never know,Adele
I have loved you all my life,Adele
How did it slow down I go round and round,Adele
I gave you heaven on a platter baby,Adele
I gave you everything you never gave me,Adele
I never lied and I never faked it,Adele
Only wanted for you to save me,Adele
This love it ain't over yet,Adele
There's too much that I haven't said ,Adele
Did you find the note that I wrote?,Adele
I hid it in the seam of your coat,Adele
It was hard to write had a lump in my throat,Adele
Do you even know that I can't let go ,Adele
Why were you so cold let the truth be told,Adele
Tell me was it all for the thrill?,Adele
What was I thinking I gave you everything,Adele
I gave you heaven on a platter baby,Adele
I gave you everything you never gave me,Adele
I never lied and I never faked it,Adele
Only wanted for you to save me ,Adele
Did you find the note that I wrote?,Adele
I hid it in the seam of your coat,Adele
It was hard to write had a lump in my throat,Adele
Do you even know that I can't let go ,Adele
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark,Adele
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms ,Adele
Did you find the note that I wrote?,Adele
I hid it in the seam of your coat,Adele
It was hard to write I had a lump in my throat,Adele
Do you even know that I can't let go ,Adele
Hope you know I won't let go I thought I told you he'd be home soon,Adele
Couldn't help myself you're too good to be true.,Adele
I fall short each time,Adele
Every time he ain't here,Adele
You and your charm creep closer,Adele
Closer and near,Adele
Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all.,Adele
Like a bomb before explosion,Adele
Ticking by your call,Adele
You're the wiser one disguised from greed,Adele
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,Adele
Than I ever did you before,Adele
So stand beside the river I cried,Adele
And lay yourself down.,Adele
Look how you want me now that I don't need you. So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees,Adele
At the first sight of you crawling back to me,Adele
To whisper will you leave your man? ,Adele
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.,Adele
I won't stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,Adele
Than I ever did you before,Adele
So stand beside the river I cried,Adele
And lay yourself down.,Adele
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! I ain't yours for no taking,Adele
You must be mistaken,Adele
I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong,Adele
And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,Adele
Than you ever did me before.,Adele
So stand beside the river you cried,Adele
And lay yourself down!,Adele
Look how you want me now that I don't need you! Found myself today singing out your name,Adele
You said I'm crazy,Adele
If I am I'm crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here,Adele
Turns me crazy,Adele
But it's you who makes me lose my head. And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible,Adele
You drift into my head,Adele
And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I'll race,Adele
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,Adele
And if you want me gone. I'll leave just hold me closer baby,Adele
And make me crazy for you.,Adele
Crazy for you. Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.,Adele
I wish you'd come over,Adele
Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my how my blood boils it's sweet taste for you,Adele
Strips me down bare,Adele
And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying fighting these feelings away,Adele
But the more I do,Adele
The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,Adele
Hoping you'll walk through,Adele
And save me boy,Adele
Because I'm too crazy for you.,Adele
Crazy for you Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on,Adele
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young,Adele
But my heart is a valley it's so shallow and man made,Adele
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake,Adele
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch,Adele
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough,Adele
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea,Adele
There was something in the water now that something's in me,Adele
Oh I can't go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips,Adele
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots it's in my veins,Adele
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it's in my roots it's in my veins,Adele
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain,Adele
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea,Adele
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it's way too late,Adele
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face,Adele
Consider this my apology I know it's years in advance,Adele
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance,Adele
No I can't go back but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips,Adele
I can't go back to the river But it's in my roots it's in my veins,Adele
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It's in my roots it's in my veins,Adele
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea,Adele
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea,Adele
If it hadn't been for love,Adele
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana,Adele
If it hadn't been for love,Adele
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain,Adele
Without one dollar to my name,Adele
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in,Adele
If it hadn't been for love,Adele
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind,Adele
If it hadn't been for love,Adele
Nobody knows it better than me,Adele
I wouldn't be wishing I was free,Adele
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love Four cold walls against my will,Adele
At least I know he's lying still,Adele
Four cold walls without parole,Adele
Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will,Adele
At least I know he's lying still,Adele
Four cold walls without parole,Adele
If it hadn't been for love,Adele
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana,Adele
If it hadn't been for love,Adele
Put myself behind a jailhouse door,Adele
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love,Adele
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love yes,Adele
If it hadn't been if it hadn't been for love yes Hold my hand while you cut me down,Adele
It had only just begun but now it's over now,Adele
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold,Adele
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold,Adele
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night,Adele
The night,Adele
When I fell off your mind I'm tired of trying,Adele
Your teasing ain't enough,Adele
Fed up of biding your time,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
And for what and for what and for what,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
Oy I'm tired Where'd you go when you stayed behind,Adele
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find,Adele
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile,Adele
I get closer you obviously prefer her I'm tired of trying,Adele
Your teasing ain't enough,Adele
Fed up of biding your time,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
And for what and for what and for what,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
Boy I'm tired of trying,Adele
Your teasing ain't enough,Adele
Fed up of biding your time,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
And for what and for what and for what,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them even though I'm tired of trying,Adele
Your teasing ain't enough,Adele
Fed up of biding your time,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
And for what and for what and for what,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
Boy I'm tired of trying,Adele
Your teasing ain't enough,Adele
Fed up of biding your time,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
And for what and for what and for what,Adele
When I don't get nothing back,Adele
Oy I'm tired Who wants to be right as rain,Adele
It's better when something is wrong,Adele
You get excitement in your bones,Adele
And everything you do's a game,Adele
When night comes and you're on your own,Adele
You can say I chose to be alone,Adele
Who wants to be right as rain,Adele
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off,Adele
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed,Adele
As far as I'm concerned,Adele
So wipe that dirty smile off,Adele
We won't be making up,Adele
I've cried my heart out,Adele
And now I've had enough of love Who wants to be riding high,Adele
When you'll just crumble back on down,Adele
You give up everything you are,Adele
And even then you don't get far,Adele
They make believe that everything,Adele
Is exactly what it seems,Adele
But at least when you're at your worst,Adele
You know how to feel things 'Cause when hard work don't pay off,Adele
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed,Adele
As far as I'm concerned,Adele
So wipe that dirty smile off,Adele
We won't be making up,Adele
I've cried my heart out,Adele
And now I've had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart,Adele
To make me cry again,Adele
'Cause it will never hurt,Adele
As much as it did then,Adele
We were both right,Adele
And no one had blame,Adele
But now I give up,Adele
On this endless game 'Cause who wants to be right as rain,Adele
It's better when something is wrong,Adele
I get excitement in my bones,Adele
Even though everything's a strain,Adele
When night comes and I'm on my own,Adele
You should know I chose to be alone,Adele
Who wants to be right as rain,Adele
It's harder when you're on top 'Cause when hard work don't pay off,Adele
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed,Adele
As far as I'm concerned,Adele
So wipe that dirty smile off,Adele
We won't be making up,Adele
I've cried my heart out,Adele
And now I've had enough of love No room in my bed,Adele
As far as I'm concerned,Adele
So wipe that dirty smile off,Adele
We won't be making up,Adele
I've cried my heart out,Adele
And now I've had enough of love So little to say but so much time,Adele
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind,Adele
Please wear the face the one where you smile,Adele
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love but I'm tired,Adele
I need to get away to feel again,Adele
Try to understand why don't get so close to change my mind,Adele
Please wipe that look out of your eyes it's bribing me to doubt myself,Adele
Simply it's tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind,Adele
And if I stay I'll be alive,Adele
Then choke on words I'd always hide,Adele
Excuse me first love but we're through,Adele
I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love but I'm too tired,Adele
I'm bored to say the least and I I lack desire,Adele
Forgive me first love forgive me first love forgive me first love,Adele
Forgive me first love forgive me forgive me first love forgive me first love This is the end,Adele
Hold your breath and count to ten,Adele
Feel the earth move and then,Adele
Hear my heart burst again For this is the end,Adele
I've drowned and dreamt this moment,Adele
So overdue I owe them,Adele
Swept away I'm stolen Let the skyfall,Adele
When it crumbles,Adele
We will stand tall,Adele
Face it all together Let the skyfall,Adele
When it crumbles,Adele
We will stand tall,Adele
Face it all together,Adele
At skyfall,Adele
At skyfall Skyfall is where we start,Adele
A thousand miles and poles apart,Adele
Where worlds collide and days are dark,Adele
You may have my number you can take my name,Adele
Face it all together,Adele
At skyfall ,Adele
When it crumbles,Adele
We will stand tall) Where you go I go,Adele
What you see I see,Adele
I know I'd never be me,Adele
Without the security,Adele
Of your loving arms,Adele
Keeping me from harm,Adele
Put your hand in my hand,Adele
Face it all together,Adele
At skyfall Let the sky fall,Adele
We will stand tall,Adele
At skyfall This is how the story went,Adele
I met someone by accident,Adele
It blew me away,Adele
Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days,Adele
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain,Adele
And buried them away you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you,Adele
When the day is done,Adele
And wake up to your face against the morning sun,Adele
But like everything I've ever known,Adele
You disappear one day,Adele
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station,Adele
Put a kiss on top of your head,Adele
Watch you wave,Adele
And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers,Adele
And neon lights and waiting papers,Adele
That I call home,Adele
I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you,Adele
When the day is done,Adele
And wake up to your face against the morning sun,Adele
But like everything I've ever known,Adele
You disappear one day,Adele
I'm going back to where I started,Adele
The morning rain the morning rain,Adele
And though I wish that you were here,Adele
On that same old road that brought me here,Adele
It's calling me home It's calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you,Adele
When the day is done,Adele
And wake up to your face against the morning sun,Adele
But like everything I've ever known,Adele
You disappear one day,Adele
So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away,Adele
I can't spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there's air made of bricks,Adele
Pulls me down turns me weak for you,Adele
I find myself repeating like a broken tune,Adele
And I'm forever excusing your intentions,Adele
That I give in to my pretendings,Adele
Which forgive you each time,Adele
Without me knowing,Adele
They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up,Adele
You say my name like there could be an us,Adele
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love,Adele
I'm the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave,Adele
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed,Adele
So desperately I try to link it with my head,Adele
But instead I fall back to my knees,Adele
As you tear your way right through me,Adele
I forgive you once again,Adele
Without me knowing,Adele
You've burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up,Adele
You say my name like there could be an us,Adele
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love,Adele
I'm the only one in love Why do you steal my hand,Adele
Whenever I'm standing my own ground,Adele
You build me up then leave me dead I hear your words you made up,Adele
I say your name like there should be an us,Adele
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love,Adele
I'm the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you,Adele
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette,Adele
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand,Adele
And thinking you would listen to all of the things,Adele
The things I had planned But we couldn't see eye to eye,Adele
So darling,Adele
Darling,Adele
Darling this is goodbye Oh,Adele
I still care,Adele
Fool that I am,Adele
Ooh,Adele
I still care,Adele
Fool that I am You say it's all in my head,Adele
And the things I think just don't make sense,Adele
So where you been then? Don't go all coy,Adele
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault,Adele
See I can see that look in your eyes,Adele
The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her,Adele
You shower me with words made of knives,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you,Adele
Do tell me why you waste our time,Adele
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied,Adele
You know I know just how you feel,Adele
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her,Adele
You shower me with words made of knives,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again I play the role of fool,Adele
Even in the daylight when you think that,Adele
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find,Adele
Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her,Adele
You shower me with words made of knives,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her,Adele
You shower me with words made of knives,Adele
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her ,Adele

I think you're stubborn 'cept you're always softening,Adele
You say I'm selfish I agree with you on that,Adele
I think you're giving out in way too much in fact,Adele
I say we've only known each other a year,Adele
You say I've known you longer my dear,Adele
You like to be so close I like to be alone,Adele
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor,Adele
Walking with each other,Adele
Think we'll never match at all but we do,Adele
But we do but we do but we do I thought I knew myself somehow you know me more,Adele
I've never known this never before,Adele
You're the first to make up whenever we argue,Adele

From the deepest part of my regret,Adele
I hear the words I wish I'd said,Adele
At the dawning of the day,Adele
I can't wait to see the light,Adele
Make up memories in my head,Adele
They help to fill the emptiness you've left,Adele
I can't drown in your tears,Adele
I won't face your fears,Adele
I need to fight my own,Adele
You'll never see me again oh baby in time,Adele
Let the weight take me under,Adele
I know I'll survive,Adele
You'll never see me again At the dawning of the day,Adele
I can't bare to see the light,Adele
Make up memories in my head,Adele
They help to fill the emptiness you've left,Adele
I can't drown in your tears,Adele
I won't face your fears,Adele
I need to fight my own,Adele
You'll never see me again oh baby in time,Adele
Let the weight take me under,Adele
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall,Adele
Let the sky come crashing down,Adele
Turn all my right to wrong,Adele
But after you that goes on,Adele
You'll never see me again,Adele
I've been learning to live without you,Adele
It's taken all of my stake,Adele
But I'm stronger now You'll never see me again oh baby in time,Adele
Let the weight take me under,Adele
I know I'll survive Let the floor beneath of me fall,Adele
Let the sky come crashing down,Adele
Turn all my right to wrong,Adele
But after you that goes on,Adele
You'll never see me again,Adele
You'll never see me again,Adele
You'll never see me again I want to see your face in every kind of light,Adele
In fields of dawn and forests of the night,Adele
And when you stand before the candles on a cake,Adele
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make What are you doing the rest of your life?,Adele
North and South and East and West of your life,Adele
I have only one request of your life,Adele
That you spend it all with me All the seasons and the times of your days,Adele
All the nickels and the dimes of your days,Adele
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days,Adele
All begin and end with me I want to see your face in every kind of light,Adele
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night,Adele
And when you stand before the candles on a cake,Adele
Oh let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes,Adele
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes,Adele
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes,Adele
It may take a kiss or two Through all of my life,Adele
Summer Winter Spring and Fall of my life,Adele
All I ever will recall of my life,Adele
Is all of my life with you Wait do you see my heart on my sleeve?,Adele
It's been there for days on end and,Adele
It's been waiting for you to open up,Adele
Yours too baby come on now,Adele
I'm trying to tell you just how,Adele
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally,Adele
Say that it's always been me That's made you feel the way you've never felt before,Adele
And I'm all you need and that you never want more,Adele
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue,Adele
But you'd save the best for last,Adele
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix,Adele
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me,Adele
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free,Adele
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest,Adele
It turns out it ain't enough,Adele
You're still not mentioning love,Adele
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?,Adele
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere,Adele
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her,Adele
And I think that I know things may never change,Adele
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say I make you feel the way you've never felt before,Adele
And I'm all you need and that you never want more,Adele
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue,Adele
But you'd save the best for last,Adele
Like I'm the one for you You should know that you're just a temporary fix,Adele
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me,Adele
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free,Adele
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me But despite the truth that I know,Adele
I find it hard to let go and give up on you,Adele
Seems I love the things you do,Adele
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am,Adele
To persist with this heartbreak and running around,Adele
And I will do until I'm finding myself you And make you feel a way you've never felt before,Adele
And be all you need so that you never want more,Adele
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue,Adele
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you I let it fall my heart,Adele
And as it fell you rose to claim it,Adele
It was dark and I was over,Adele
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands they're strong,Adele
But my knees were far too weak,Adele
To stand in your arms,Adele
Without falling to your feet But there's a side to you,Adele
That I never knew never knew,Adele
All the things you'd say,Adele
They were never true never true,Adele
And the games you play,Adele
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Well it burned while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,Adele
Your name When I lay with you,Adele
I could stay there,Adele
Close my eyes,Adele
Feel you here forever,Adele
You and me together nothing gets better 'Cause there's a side to you,Adele
That I never knew never knew,Adele
All the things you'd say,Adele
They were never true never true,Adele
And the games you play,Adele
You would always win always win But I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Well it burned while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming out your name,Adele
Your name I set fire to the rain,Adele
And I threw us into the flames,Adele
Well it felt something died,Adele
'Cause I knew that that was,Adele
The last time the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,Adele
That heart you caught must be waiting for you,Adele
Even now when we're already over,Adele
I can't help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain,Adele
Watched it pour as I touched your face,Adele
Well it burned while I cried,Adele
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,Adele
Your name I set fire to the rain,Adele
And I threw us into the flames,Adele
Well it felt something died,Adele
Cause I knew that that was the last time,Adele
The last time Let it burn,Adele
Let it burn,Adele
Let it burn ,Adele
I would never lie to you unless you tell me to...,Adele
Every part of me,Adele
All my words to hold,Adele
And hold against me,Adele
Why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart,Adele
No I'm not gonna do it standing up,Adele
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me,Adele
Help me baby,Adele
Won't you turn off the lights Lay me down,Adele
'til the morning!,Adele
You can read my mind be it truth or lies,Adele
Lie down beside me why won't you let it be? Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart,Adele
No I'm not gonna do it standing up,Adele
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me,Adele
Lay down with me,Adele
Lay down with me,Adele
Lay down with me Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me,Adele
Lay me down,Adele
Someone believe me Never been a girl who used to cry,Adele
Didn`t show emotions don`t know why,Adele
Didn`t wanna feel the pain inside I guess But as the years keep going by,Adele
you came along and changed my mind,Adele
I should leave the past behind me,Adele
I should let you find me,Adele
supposed to stay beside me,Adele
You were supposed to guide me,Adele
through the ups and downs,Adele
you were always gonna be around until the end I still think we could,Adele
`cause you and me we`re good,Adele
And I`ll tell you why this hurts 'cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk,Adele
so I can forget about you,Adele
and all the stupid things that love has put me through,Adele
Even when I've had too much,Adele
I still feel your touch,Adele
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough So I pour myself another drink,Adele
whenever I start to think about you,Adele
`cause I do but I really don`t want to,Adele
but sometimes my dreams just come through And when I get there,Adele
to a place where I see you in a kitchen,Adele
I start wishing for that thing and I don`t need you,Adele
I don`t really wanna see you,Adele
and I don`t want you to see me,Adele
you would think that I was crazy,Adele
you might think that I wanna be close to you,Adele
but I`d rather wanna drink some Whisky,Adele
and maybe have a little sip `o wine,Adele
`cause right now it`s the only thing that makes me forget you were mine,Adele
but right now I am sober But I just wanna be drunk,Adele
so I can forget about you,Adele
and all the stupid things that love has put me through,Adele
Even when I've had too much,Adele
I still feel your touch,Adele
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough I still think we could,Adele
`cause you and me we`re good,Adele
`cause I`m sober But I just wanna be drunk,Adele
so I can forget about you,Adele
and all the stupid things that love has put me through,Adele
Even when I've had too much,Adele
I still feel your touch,Adele
But I just wanna be drunk,Adele
so I can forget about you,Adele
and all the stupid things that love has put me through,Adele
Even when I've had too much,Adele
I still feel your touch,Adele
Maybe this just means that I`m not drunk enough Think I've had enough,Adele
I must my way,Adele
I've fallen off the edge to find that I've gone blind,Adele
You're leading me astray,Adele
You haunt me like a ghost,Adele
And that scares me the most,Adele
There you are the devil on my shoulder,Adele
Smiling as the flames are growing colder,Adele
How can I believer what I have?,Adele
For a little confidence I'll grab But when my hand goes out don't take it for I'm trying to make it on my own,Adele
I fell it in my bones any minute now!,Adele
This train of thought will leave the statio,Adele
My impatience will come out to play,Adele
You've turned out to be the only face I see!,Adele
Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room,Adele
You spin a web in every room,Adele
And try to break the backbone that I've grown,Adele
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown,Adele
Will I make my own path or wander where I'm thrown,Adele
Or wander where I'm thrown? When we used,Adele
To say goodnight,Adele
I'd always kiss,Adele
And hold you tight,Adele
But lately,Adele
You don't seem,Adele
To care,Adele
You close the door,Adele
And leave me,Adele
Standing there,Adele
Oh honey,Adele
That's not fair,Adele
That's it,Adele
I quit,Adele
I'm movin' on The other night,Adele
We had a date,Adele
An you showed up,Adele
Two hours late,Adele

Was all in place,Adele
Somebody smeared,Adele

On your face,Adele
Oh they smeared it,Adele
Every place,Adele

And fall,Adele
But if I,Adele

'Cause I love,Adele
Everything you got,Adele

What you know is true,Adele
Don't have to tell you,Adele
I love your precious heart I was standing,Adele
You were there,Adele
Two worlds collided,Adele
And they could never tear us apart We could live,Adele
For a thousand years,Adele
But if I hurt you,Adele
I'd make wine from your tears I told you,Adele
That we could fly,Adele
'Cause we all have wings,Adele
But some of us don't know why I,Adele
I was standing,Adele
You were there,Adele
Two worlds collided,Adele
And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you're scared of the light,Adele
But how will you ever know if you never try,Adele
There's something new inside my heart,Adele
And it grabs like a child whenever we're apart,Adele
I see your face under every sky,Adele
I find the less I look more I find,Adele
So let's go back there back to the star,Adele
You know I'm never gonna leave you,Adele
You're the only one I want,Adele
Let's go back there back to the star,Adele
You know I'm never gonna leave you,Adele
You're the only one I want You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark,Adele
But I'm feeling sun babe when I'm in your arms,Adele
You said my name in the dead of glory,Adele
You hold me alright,Adele
When I'm short of falling So let's go back there back to the star,Adele
You know I'm never gonna leave you,Adele
You're the only one I want,Adele
Let's go back there back to the star,Adele
You know I'm never gonna leave you,Adele
You're the only one I want There will be times,Adele
When we'll try to give it up,Adele
Bursting out it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces,Adele
And we'll watch them turn to dust,Adele
But without each other nothing is easy enough So let's go back there back to the star,Adele
You know I'm never gonna leave you,Adele
You're the only one I want,Adele
Let's go back there back to the star,Adele

Take whatever is left and take it with you out the door,Adele
See if I cry,Adele
See if I shed a single sorry tear,Adele
Can't say that it's been that great,Adele
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year ,Adele
Everybody sees,Adele
And everyone agrees,Adele
That you and I are wrong,Adele
And it's been that way to long,Adele
Take it as it comes,Adele
And be thankful when it's done,Adele
There's so many ways to act,Adele
And there's many shades of black,Adele
There's so many shades of black Let it out let it all out,Adele
Say what's on your mind,Adele
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind,Adele
Cause in the back of my mind and on the tip of my tongue,Adele
There's so many shades of black,Adele
Yeah there's any shades of black,Adele
There's so many shades of black,Adele
Yeah there's many shades of black,Adele

,Bruce Springsteen
They come from everywhere,Bruce Springsteen
A longing to be free,Bruce Springsteen
They come to join us here,Bruce Springsteen
From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream,Bruce Springsteen
As people always will,Bruce Springsteen
To be safe and warm,Bruce Springsteen
In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door,Bruce Springsteen
Instead of opening the gate,Bruce Springsteen
Aw let's turn this thing around,Bruce Springsteen
Before it gets too late ,Bruce Springsteen
It's up to me and you,Bruce Springsteen
Love can conquer hate,Bruce Springsteen
I know this to be true,Bruce Springsteen
That's what makes us great ,Bruce Springsteen
Don't tell me a lie,Bruce Springsteen
And sell it as a fact,Bruce Springsteen
I've been down that road before,Bruce Springsteen
And I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me,Bruce Springsteen
That you never read a book,Bruce Springsteen
I never put my faith,Bruce Springsteen
In a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path,Bruce Springsteen
And tempt the hands of fate,Bruce Springsteen
Aw let's turn this thing around,Bruce Springsteen
Before it gets too late ,Bruce Springsteen
It's up to me and you,Bruce Springsteen
Love can conquer hate,Bruce Springsteen
I know this to be true,Bruce Springsteen
That's what makes us great In the quiet of the night,Bruce Springsteen
I lie here wide awake,Bruce Springsteen
And I ask myself,Bruce Springsteen
Is there a difference I can make? ,Bruce Springsteen
It's up to me and you,Bruce Springsteen
Love can conquer hate,Bruce Springsteen
I know this to be true,Bruce Springsteen
That's what makes us great I come from down in the valley,Bruce Springsteen
Where mister when you're young,Bruce Springsteen
They bring you up to do like your daddy done,Bruce Springsteen
Me and Mary we met in high school,Bruce Springsteen
When she was just seventeen,Bruce Springsteen
We'd ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green,Bruce Springsteen
We'd go down to the river,Bruce Springsteen
And into the river we'd dive,Bruce Springsteen
Oh down to the river we'd ride Then I got Mary pregnant,Bruce Springsteen
And man that was all she wrote,Bruce Springsteen
And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat,Bruce Springsteen
We went down to the courthouse,Bruce Springsteen
And the judge put it all to rest,Bruce Springsteen
No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle,Bruce Springsteen
No flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river,Bruce Springsteen
And into the river we'd dive,Bruce Springsteen
Oh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company,Bruce Springsteen
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy,Bruce Springsteen
Now all them things that seemed so important,Bruce Springsteen
Well mister they vanished right into the air,Bruce Springsteen
Now I just act like I don't remember,Bruce Springsteen
Mary acts like she don't care But I remember us riding in my brother's car,Bruce Springsteen
Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir,Bruce Springsteen
At night on them banks I'd lie awake,Bruce Springsteen
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take,Bruce Springsteen
Now those memories come back to haunt me,Bruce Springsteen
They haunt me like a curse,Bruce Springsteen
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true,Bruce Springsteen
Or is it something worse,Bruce Springsteen
That sends me down to the river,Bruce Springsteen
Though I know the river is dry,Bruce Springsteen
That sends me down to the river tonight,Bruce Springsteen
Down to the river,Bruce Springsteen
My baby and I,Bruce Springsteen
Oh down to the river we ride The screen door slams Mary's dress waves,Bruce Springsteen
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays,Bruce Springsteen
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely,Bruce Springsteen
Hey that's me and I want you only,Bruce Springsteen
Don't turn me home again I just can't face myself alone again,Bruce Springsteen
Don't run back inside darling you know just what I'm here for,Bruce Springsteen
So you're scared and you're thinking that maybe we ain't that young anymore,Bruce Springsteen
Show a little faith there's magic in the night,Bruce Springsteen
You ain't a beauty but hey you're alright,Bruce Springsteen
Oh and that's alright with me You can hide 'neath your covers and study your pain,Bruce Springsteen
Make crosses from your lovers throw roses in the rain,Bruce Springsteen
Waste your summer praying in vain,Bruce Springsteen
For a savior to rise from these streets,Bruce Springsteen
Well now I ain't no hero that's understood,Bruce Springsteen
All the redemption I can offer girl is beneath this dirty hood,Bruce Springsteen
With a chance to make it good somehow,Bruce Springsteen
Hey what else can we do now?,Bruce Springsteen
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair,Bruce Springsteen
Well the night's busting open these two lanes will take us anywhere,Bruce Springsteen
We got one last chance to make it real,Bruce Springsteen
To trade in these wings on some wheels,Bruce Springsteen
Climb in back heaven's waiting on down the tracks Oh oh come take my hand,Bruce Springsteen
We're riding out tonight to case the promised land,Bruce Springsteen
Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road,Bruce Springsteen
Oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road,Bruce Springsteen
Lying out there like a killer in the sun,Bruce Springsteen
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run,Bruce Springsteen
Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road,Bruce Springsteen
Sit tight take hold Thunder Road Well I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk,Bruce Springsteen
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk,Bruce Springsteen
From your front porch to my front seat,Bruce Springsteen
The door's open but the ride ain't free,Bruce Springsteen
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken,Bruce Springsteen
But tonight we'll be free all the promises'll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away,Bruce Springsteen
They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets,Bruce Springsteen
They scream your name at night in the street,Bruce Springsteen
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet,Bruce Springsteen
And in the lonely cool before dawn,Bruce Springsteen
You hear their engines rolling on,Bruce Springsteen
But when you get to the porch they're gone on the wind,Bruce Springsteen
So Mary climb in,Bruce Springsteen
It's a town full of losers I'm pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening,Bruce Springsteen
And I ain't got nothing to say,Bruce Springsteen
I come home in the morning,Bruce Springsteen
I go to bed feeling the same way,Bruce Springsteen
I ain't nothing but tired,Bruce Springsteen
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself,Bruce Springsteen
Hey there baby I could use just a little help You can't start a fire,Bruce Springsteen
You can't start a fire without a spark,Bruce Springsteen
This gun's for hire,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark Message keeps getting clearer,Bruce Springsteen
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place,Bruce Springsteen
I check my look in the mirror,Bruce Springsteen
I want to change my clothes my hair my face,Bruce Springsteen
Man I ain't getting nowhere,Bruce Springsteen
I'm just living in a dump like this,Bruce Springsteen
There's something happening somewhere,Bruce Springsteen
Baby I just know that there is You can't start a fire,Bruce Springsteen
You can't start a fire without a spark,Bruce Springsteen
This gun's for hire,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older,Bruce Springsteen
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me,Bruce Springsteen
I'll shake this world off my shoulders,Bruce Springsteen
Come on baby this laugh's on me Stay on the streets of this town,Bruce Springsteen
And they'll be carving you up alright,Bruce Springsteen
They say you gotta stay hungry,Bruce Springsteen
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight,Bruce Springsteen
I'm dying for some action,Bruce Springsteen
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book,Bruce Springsteen
I need a love reaction,Bruce Springsteen
Come on now baby gimme just one look You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart,Bruce Springsteen
This gun's for hire,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark,Bruce Springsteen
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart,Bruce Springsteen
This gun's for hire,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark,Bruce Springsteen
Even if we're just dancing in the dark,Bruce Springsteen
Hey baby Well it seems like I'm caught up in your trap again,Bruce Springsteen
And it seems like I'll be wearing the same old chains,Bruce Springsteen
Good will conquer evil and the truth will set me free,Bruce Springsteen
And I know someday I will find the key,Bruce Springsteen
And I know somewhere I will find the key Well it seems like I've been playing your game way too long,Bruce Springsteen
And it seems the game I've played has made you strong,Bruce Springsteen
But when the game is over I won't walk out the loser,Bruce Springsteen
Yeah I know that I'll walk out of here again,Bruce Springsteen

I'm trapped In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream,Bruce Springsteen
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines,Bruce Springsteen
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,Bruce Springsteen
Chrome wheeled fuel injectedand steppin' out over the line,Bruce Springsteen
H-Oh Baby this town rips the bones from your back,Bruce Springsteen
It's a death trap it's a suicide rap,Bruce Springsteen
We gotta get out while we're young,Bruce Springsteen

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors,Bruce Springsteen
And the boys try to look so hard,Bruce Springsteen
The amusement park rises bold and stark,Bruce Springsteen
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist,Bruce Springsteen
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight,Bruce Springsteen
In an everlasting kiss One two three four! The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive,Bruce Springsteen
Everybody's out on the run tonight,Bruce Springsteen
But there's no place left to hide,Bruce Springsteen
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness,Bruce Springsteen
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul,Bruce Springsteen

And hearts of fire grow cold,Bruce Springsteen
We swore blood brothers against the wind,Bruce Springsteen
Now I'm ready to grow young again,Bruce Springsteen
And hear your sister's voice calling us home,Bruce Springsteen
Across the open yards,Bruce Springsteen
Well maybe we'll cut someplace of our own,Bruce Springsteen
With these drums and these guitars 'Cause we made a promise we swore we'd always remember,Bruce Springsteen
No retreat baby no surrender,Bruce Springsteen
Blood brothers in the stormy night,Bruce Springsteen
With a vow to defend,Bruce Springsteen
No retreat baby no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim,Bruce Springsteen
The walls of my room are closing in,Bruce Springsteen
There's a war outside still raging,Bruce Springsteen
You say it ain't ours anymore to win,Bruce Springsteen
I want to sleep beneath,Bruce Springsteen
Peaceful skies in my lover's bed,Bruce Springsteen
With a wide open country in my eyes,Bruce Springsteen
And these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we'd always remember,Bruce Springsteen
No retreat baby no surrender,Bruce Springsteen
Blood brothers in a stormy night,Bruce Springsteen
With a vow to defend,Bruce Springsteen

Ohh ohh ohh,Bruce Springsteen
Ohh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio,Bruce Springsteen
Back in eighteen-o-three,Bruce Springsteen
James and Danny Heaton,Bruce Springsteen
Found the ore that was linin' yellow creek,Bruce Springsteen
They built a blast furnace,Bruce Springsteen
Here along the shore,Bruce Springsteen
And they made the cannon balls,Bruce Springsteen
That helped the union win the war Here in Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
Here in Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down,Bruce Springsteen
Here darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy worked the furnaces,Bruce Springsteen
Kept 'em hotter than hell,Bruce Springsteen
I come home from 'Nam worked my way to scarfer,Bruce Springsteen
A job that'd suit the devil as well,Bruce Springsteen
Taconite coke and limestone,Bruce Springsteen
Fed my children and made my pay,Bruce Springsteen
Then smokestacks reachin' like the arms of god,Bruce Springsteen
Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay Here in Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
Here in Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down,Bruce Springsteen
Here darlin' in Youngstown Well my daddy come on the 0hio works,Bruce Springsteen
When he come home from world war two,Bruce Springsteen
Now the yards just scrap and rubble,Bruce Springsteen
He said Them big boys did what Hitler couldn't do,Bruce Springsteen
These mills they built the tanks and bombs,Bruce Springsteen
That won this country's wars,Bruce Springsteen
We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam,Bruce Springsteen
Now we're wondering what they were dyin' for Here in Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
Here in Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down,Bruce Springsteen
Here darlin' in Youngstown From the Monongaleh valley,Bruce Springsteen
To the Mesabi iron range,Bruce Springsteen
To the coal mines of Appalacchia,Bruce Springsteen
The story's always the same,Bruce Springsteen
Seven-hundred tons of metal a day,Bruce Springsteen
Now sir you tell me the world's changed,Bruce Springsteen
Once I made you rich enough,Bruce Springsteen
Rich enough to forget my name In Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
In Youngstown,Bruce Springsteen
My sweet Jenny I'm sinkin' down,Bruce Springsteen
Here darlin' in Youngstown When I die I don't want no part of heaven,Bruce Springsteen
I would not do heavens work well,Bruce Springsteen
I pray the devil comes and takes me,Bruce Springsteen
To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell The Rangers had a homecoming,Bruce Springsteen
In Harlem late last night,Bruce Springsteen
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine,Bruce Springsteen
Over the Jersey state line,Bruce Springsteen
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge,Bruce Springsteen
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain,Bruce Springsteen
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants,Bruce Springsteen
Together they take a stab at romance,Bruce Springsteen
And disappear down Flamingo Lane Well the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo,Bruce Springsteen
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl,Bruce Springsteen
And the kids 'round there live just like shadows,Bruce Springsteen
Always quiet holding hands,Bruce Springsteen
From the churches to the jails,Bruce Springsteen
Tonight all is silence in the world,Bruce Springsteen
As we take our stand,Bruce Springsteen
Down in Jungleland The midnight gang's assembled,Bruce Springsteen
And picked a rendezvous for the night,Bruce Springsteen
They'll meet 'neath that giant Exxon sign,Bruce Springsteen
That brings this fair city light,Bruce Springsteen
Man there's an opera out on the Turnpike,Bruce Springsteen
There's a ballet being fought out in the alley,Bruce Springsteen
Until the local cops Cherry-Tops rips this holy night,Bruce Springsteen
The street's alive as secret debts are paid,Bruce Springsteen
Contacts made they flash unseen,Bruce Springsteen
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades,Bruce Springsteen
Hustling for the record machine,Bruce Springsteen
The hungry and the hunted,Bruce Springsteen
Explode into rock 'n' roll bands,Bruce Springsteen
That face off against each other out in the street,Bruce Springsteen
Down in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage,Bruce Springsteen
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing,Bruce Springsteen
To the records that the DJ plays,Bruce Springsteen
Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners,Bruce Springsteen
Desperate as the night moves on,Bruce Springsteen
Just one look and a whisper and they're gone Beneath the city two hearts beat,Bruce Springsteen
Soul engines running through a night so tender,Bruce Springsteen
In a bedroom locked in whispers,Bruce Springsteen
Of soft refusal and then surrender,Bruce Springsteen
In the tunnels uptown the Rat's own dream guns him down,Bruce Springsteen
As shots echo down them hallways in the night,Bruce Springsteen
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away,Bruce Springsteen
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street's on fire in a real death waltz,Bruce Springsteen
Between what's flesh and what's fantasy,Bruce Springsteen
And the poets down here don't write nothing at all,Bruce Springsteen
They just stand back and let it all be,Bruce Springsteen
And in the quick of a knife they reach for their moment,Bruce Springsteen
And try to make an honest stand,Bruce Springsteen
But they wind up wounded not even dead,Bruce Springsteen
Tonight in Jungleland I've been working real hard trying to get my hands clean,Bruce Springsteen
We'll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline,Bruce Springsteen
To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue,Bruce Springsteen
Baby just one kiss will get these things for you,Bruce Springsteen
A kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night,Bruce Springsteen

Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end Our love has fallen around us,Bruce Springsteen
Like we said it never would,Bruce Springsteen
We saw it happen to all the others,Bruce Springsteen
But to us it never would,Bruce Springsteen
Well how could something so bad darling,Bruce Springsteen
Come from something that was so good,Bruce Springsteen
I don't know But it was like we held a noose,Bruce Springsteen
And baby without check,Bruce Springsteen
We pulled 'til it grew tighter around our necks,Bruce Springsteen
Each one waiting for the other,Bruce Springsteen
Darling to say when,Bruce Springsteen
Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end On a loose end There's a pale horse comin',Bruce Springsteen
I'm gonna ride it,Bruce Springsteen
I'll rise in the morning,Bruce Springsteen
My fate decided,Bruce Springsteen
I'm a dead man walkin',Bruce Springsteen
I'm a dead man walkin' In St. James Parish,Bruce Springsteen
I was born and christened,Bruce Springsteen
Now I've got my story,Bruce Springsteen
Mister no need for you to listen,Bruce Springsteen
It's just a dead man talkin' Once I had a job I had a girl,Bruce Springsteen
But between our dreams and actions,Bruce Springsteen
Lies this world In the deep forest,Bruce Springsteen
Their blood and tears rushed over me,Bruce Springsteen
All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun,Bruce Springsteen
And my fear up inside of me,Bruce Springsteen
Like a dead man talkin' 'Neath a summer sky my eyes went black,Bruce Springsteen
Sister I won't ask for forgiveness,Bruce Springsteen
My sins are all I have Now the clouds above my prison,Bruce Springsteen
Move slowly across the sky,Bruce Springsteen
There's a new day comin',Bruce Springsteen
And my dreams are full tonight I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand,Bruce Springsteen
Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man,Bruce Springsteen
I'd sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town,Bruce Springsteen
He'd tousle my hair and say son take a good look around,Bruce Springsteen
This is your hometown,Bruce Springsteen
This is your hometown,Bruce Springsteen
This is your hometown,Bruce Springsteen
This is your hometown In '65 tension was running high at my high school,Bruce Springsteen
There was a lot of fights between the black and white,Bruce Springsteen
There was nothing you could do,Bruce Springsteen
Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun,Bruce Springsteen
Words were passed in a shotgun blast,Bruce Springsteen
Troubled times had come,Bruce Springsteen
To my hometown,Bruce Springsteen
My hometown,Bruce Springsteen
My hometown,Bruce Springsteen
My hometown Now Main Street's whitewashed windows and vacant stores,Bruce Springsteen
Seems like there ain't nobody wants to come down here no more,Bruce Springsteen
They're closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks,Bruce Springsteen
Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain't coming back,Bruce Springsteen
To your hometown,Bruce Springsteen
Your hometown,Bruce Springsteen
Your hometown,Bruce Springsteen
Your hometown Last night me and Kate we laid in bed,Bruce Springsteen
Talking about getting out,Bruce Springsteen
Packing up our bags maybe heading south,Bruce Springsteen
I'm thirty five we got a boy of our own now,Bruce Springsteen
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around,Bruce Springsteen
This is your hometown Tear drops on the city Bad Scooter searching for his groove,Bruce Springsteen
Seem like the whole world walking pretty and you can't find the room to move,Bruce Springsteen
Well everybody better move over that's all,Bruce Springsteen
'Cause I'm running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall,Bruce Springsteen
Tenth Avenue freeze-out,Bruce Springsteen
Tenth Avenue freeze-out Well I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving,Bruce Springsteen
The night is dark but the sidewalk's bright and lined with the light of the living,Bruce Springsteen
From a tenement window a transistor blasts,Bruce Springsteen
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast,Bruce Springsteen
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out,Bruce Springsteen
Tenth Avenue freeze-out And I'm all alone I'm all alone,Bruce Springsteen
And I'm on my own I'm on my own,Bruce Springsteen
And I can't go home When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band,Bruce Springsteen
From the coastline to the city all the little pretties raise their hands,Bruce Springsteen
I'm gonna sit back right easy and laugh,Bruce Springsteen
When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half,Bruce Springsteen
With the Tenth Avenue freeze-out,Bruce Springsteen
Tenth Avenue freeze-out,Bruce Springsteen
Tenth Avenue freeze-out,Bruce Springsteen
Tenth Avenue freeze,Bruce Springsteen
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth,Bruce Springsteen
Oh nothing but a Tenth,Bruce Springsteen
I'm talking 'bout a Tenth,Bruce Springsteen
I'm talking bout a Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth Tenth,Bruce Springsteen

Tenth Avenue freeze-out... The times are tough now just getting tougher,Bruce Springsteen
This whole world is rough it's just getting rougher,Bruce Springsteen
Cover me come on baby cover me,Bruce Springsteen
Well I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Now promise me baby you won't let them find us,Bruce Springsteen
Hold me in your arms let's let our love blind us,Bruce Springsteen
Cover me shut the door and cover me,Bruce Springsteen
I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Outside's the rain the driving snow,Bruce Springsteen
I can hear the wild wind blowing,Bruce Springsteen
Turn out the light bolt the door,Bruce Springsteen

Ah looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me,Bruce Springsteen
Yeah I'm looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me In Candy's room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall,Bruce Springsteen
But to get to Candy's room you gotta walk the darkness of Candy's hall,Bruce Springsteen
Strangers from the city call my baby's number and they bring her toys,Bruce Springsteen
When I come knocking she smiles pretty she knows I want to be Candy's boy There's a sadness hidden in that pretty face,Bruce Springsteen
A sadness all her own,Bruce Springsteen
From which no man can keep Candy safe We kiss my heart's pumpin' to my brain,Bruce Springsteen
And the blood rushes in my veins the fire rushes towards the skies,Bruce Springsteen
I go driving driving deep into the night,Bruce Springsteen
I go driving deep into the light in Candy's eyes She says baby if you want to be wild,Bruce Springsteen
You got a lot to learn close your eyes,Bruce Springsteen
Let them melt let them fire,Bruce Springsteen
Let them burn,Bruce Springsteen
Cause in the darkness there'll be hidden worlds that shine,Bruce Springsteen
When I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine She has fancy clothes and diamond rings,Bruce Springsteen
She has men who give her anything she wants but they don't see,Bruce Springsteen
That what she wants is me Oh and I want her so,Bruce Springsteen
I'll never let her go no no no,Bruce Springsteen
She knows that I'd give,Bruce Springsteen
All that I got to give,Bruce Springsteen
All that I want all that I live,Bruce Springsteen
To make Candy mine,Bruce Springsteen
Tonight She'll let you in her house,Bruce Springsteen
If you come knockin' late at night,Bruce Springsteen
She'll let you in her mouth,Bruce Springsteen
If the words you say are right If you pay the price,Bruce Springsteen
She'll let you deep inside,Bruce Springsteen
But there's a secret garden she hides She'll let you in her car,Bruce Springsteen
To go drivin' round,Bruce Springsteen
She'll let you into the parts of herself,Bruce Springsteen
That'll bring you down She'll let you in herheart,Bruce Springsteen
If you got a hammer and a vise,Bruce Springsteen
But into her secret garden don't think twice You've gone a million miles,Bruce Springsteen
How far'd you get,Bruce Springsteen
To that place where You can't remember,Bruce Springsteen
And you can't forget She'll lead you down a path,Bruce Springsteen
There'll be tenderness in the air,Bruce Springsteen
She'll let you come just far enough,Bruce Springsteen
So you know she's really there,Bruce Springsteen
She'll look at you and smile,Bruce Springsteen
And her eyes will say,Bruce Springsteen
She's got a secret garden,Bruce Springsteen
Where everything you want,Bruce Springsteen
Where everything you need,Bruce Springsteen
Will always stay,Bruce Springsteen
A million miles away You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face,Bruce Springsteen
And you try so hard to see,Bruce Springsteen
The way things were when we were at your place,Bruce Springsteen
Everyday was just you and me,Bruce Springsteen
And you cry because things ain't like before,Bruce Springsteen
Well don't you know it can't be that way anymore,Bruce Springsteen
But don't worry baby,Bruce Springsteen
cause I can't talk now I'm not alone,Bruce Springsteen
So put your ear close to the phone,Bruce Springsteen

For hearts of stone If there was something baby,Bruce Springsteen
That I could do,Bruce Springsteen
Something that would last honey I would,Bruce Springsteen
But you should know better than to think that you,Bruce Springsteen
Can return to the past,Bruce Springsteen
So close your eyes and I'll be there,Bruce Springsteen
Hold you once more and not go anywhere,Bruce Springsteen
I wish I could babe,Bruce Springsteen
But I can't talk now I'm not alone,Bruce Springsteen
So put your ear close to the phone,Bruce Springsteen

For hearts of stone And you cry because things get so strange so fast,Bruce Springsteen
And you cry because nothing good ever lasts,Bruce Springsteen

For hearts of stone I went out walking the other day,Bruce Springsteen
Seen a little girl crying along the way,Bruce Springsteen
She'd been hurt so bad said she'd never love again,Bruce Springsteen
Some day your crying girl will end,Bruce Springsteen
And you'll find once again Two hearts are better than one,Bruce Springsteen
Two hearts girl get the job done,Bruce Springsteen
Two hearts are better than one Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes,Bruce Springsteen
But I was living in a world of childish dreams,Bruce Springsteen
Someday these childish dreams must end,Bruce Springsteen
To become a man and grow up to dream again,Bruce Springsteen
I believe in the end Two hearts are better than one,Bruce Springsteen
Two hearts girl get the job done,Bruce Springsteen
Two hearts are better than one Sometimes it might seem like it was planned,Bruce Springsteen
For you to roam empty-hearted through this land,Bruce Springsteen
Though the world turns you hard and cold,Bruce Springsteen
There's one thing mister that I know,Bruce Springsteen
That's if you think your heart is stone,Bruce Springsteen
And that you're rough enough to whip this world alone,Bruce Springsteen
Alone buddy there ain't no peace of mind,Bruce Springsteen
That's why I'll keep searching 'til I find my special one Two hearts are better than one,Bruce Springsteen

A longing to be free,Bruce Springsteen
They come to join us here,Bruce Springsteen
From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream,Bruce Springsteen
As people always will,Bruce Springsteen
To be safe and warm,Bruce Springsteen
In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door,Bruce Springsteen
Instead of opening the gate,Bruce Springsteen
Aw let's turn this thing around,Bruce Springsteen
Before it gets too late ,Bruce Springsteen
It's up to me and you,Bruce Springsteen
Love can conquer hate,Bruce Springsteen

And sell it as a fact,Bruce Springsteen
I've been down that road before,Bruce Springsteen
And I ain't goin' back And don't you brag to me,Bruce Springsteen
That you never read a book,Bruce Springsteen
I never put my faith,Bruce Springsteen
In a con man and his crooks I won't follow down that path,Bruce Springsteen
And tempt the hands of fate,Bruce Springsteen
Aw let's turn this thing around,Bruce Springsteen
Before it gets too late ,Bruce Springsteen
It's up to me and you,Bruce Springsteen
Love can conquer hate,Bruce Springsteen

I lie here wide awake,Bruce Springsteen
And I ask myself,Bruce Springsteen
Is there a difference I can make? ,Bruce Springsteen
It's up to me and you,Bruce Springsteen
Love can conquer hate,Bruce Springsteen
I know this to be true,Bruce Springsteen

Like a cup,Dickinson
Discarded of the housewife,Dickinson
Quaint or broken;,Dickinson
A newer Sevres pleases,Dickinson
Old ones crack.,Dickinson
I could not die with you,Dickinson
For one must wait,Dickinson
To shut the other's gaze down ,Dickinson

And see you freeze,Dickinson
Without my right of frost,Dickinson
Death's privilege?,Dickinson
Nor could I rise with you,Dickinson
Because your face,Dickinson
Would put out Jesus',Dickinson
That new grace,Dickinson
Glow plain and foreign,Dickinson
On my homesick eye,Dickinson
Except that you than he,Dickinson
Shone closer by.,Dickinson
They'd judge us  how?,Dickinson
For you served Heaven you know,Dickinson
Or sought to;,Dickinson
I could not,Dickinson
Because you saturated sight,Dickinson

Though my name,Dickinson
Rang loudest,Dickinson
On the heavenly fame.,Dickinson

I thought that such were for the saints,Dickinson
Where revelations be.,Dickinson
The sun as common went abroad,Dickinson
The flowers accustomed blew,Dickinson
As if no soul the solstice passed,Dickinson
That maketh all things new.,Dickinson
The time was scarce profaned by speech;,Dickinson
The symbol of a word,Dickinson
Was needless as at sacrament,Dickinson
The wardrobe of our Lord.,Dickinson
Each was to each the sealed church,Dickinson
Permitted to commune this time,Dickinson
Lest we too awkward show,Dickinson
At supper of the Lamb.,Dickinson
The hours slid fast as hours will,Dickinson
Clutched tight by greedy hands;,Dickinson
So faces on two decks look back,Dickinson
Bound to opposing lands.,Dickinson
And so when all the time had failed,Dickinson
Without external sound,Dickinson
Each bound the other's crucifix,Dickinson
We gave no other bond.,Dickinson
Sufficient troth that we shall rise ,Dickinson
Deposed at length the grave ,Dickinson
To that new marriage justified,Dickinson
Through Calvaries of Love!,Dickinson

LOVE'S BAPTISM.,Dickinson

I've finished threading too.,Dickinson
Baptized before without the choice,Dickinson
But this time consciously of grace,Dickinson
Unto supremest name,Dickinson
Called to my full the crescent dropped,Dickinson
Existence's whole arc filled up,Dickinson
With one small diadem.,Dickinson
My second rank too small the first,Dickinson
Crowned crowing on my father's breast,Dickinson
A half unconscious queen;,Dickinson
But this time adequate erect,Dickinson
With will to choose or to reject.,Dickinson
And I choose  just a throne.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
RESURRECTION.,Dickinson
T was a long parting but the time,Dickinson
For interview had come;,Dickinson
The last and second time,Dickinson
These fleshless lovers met,Dickinson
A heaven in a gaze,Dickinson
A heaven of heavens the privilege,Dickinson
Of one another's eyes.,Dickinson
No lifetime set on them,Dickinson
Apparelled as the new,Dickinson
Unborn except they had beheld,Dickinson
Born everlasting now.,Dickinson
Was bridal e'er like this?,Dickinson
A paradise the host,Dickinson
And cherubim and seraphim,Dickinson
The most familiar guest.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
APOCALYPSE.,Dickinson
I'm wife; I've finished that,Dickinson
That other state;,Dickinson
I'm Czar I'm woman now,Dickinson
It's safer so.,Dickinson
How odd the girl's life looks,Dickinson
Behind this soft eclipse!,Dickinson

To those in heaven now.,Dickinson
This being comfort then,Dickinson
That other kind was pain;,Dickinson
But why compare?,Dickinson

XVII.,Dickinson
THE WIFE.,Dickinson
She rose to his requirement dropped,Dickinson
The playthings of her life,Dickinson
To take the honorable work,Dickinson
Of woman and of wife.,Dickinson
If aught she missed in her new day,Dickinson
Of amplitude or awe,Dickinson
Or first prospective or the gold,Dickinson
In using wore away,Dickinson
It lay unmentioned as the sea,Dickinson
Develops pearl and weed,Dickinson
But only to himself is known,Dickinson
The fathoms they abide.,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
APOTHEOSIS.,Dickinson
Come slowly Eden!,Dickinson
Lips unused to thee,Dickinson
Bashful sip thy jasmines,Dickinson
As the fainting bee,Dickinson
Reaching late his flower,Dickinson
Round her chamber hums,Dickinson
Counts his nectars  enters,Dickinson
And is lost in balms!,Dickinson
III. NATURE.,Dickinson

New feet within my garden go,Dickinson
New fingers stir the sod;,Dickinson

And still the pensive spring returns,Dickinson
And still the punctual snow!,Dickinson

Covert in April,Dickinson
Candid in May,Dickinson
Dear to the moss,Dickinson

Next to the robin,Dickinson
In every human soul.,Dickinson
Bold little beauty,Dickinson
Bedecked with thee,Dickinson
Nature forswears,Dickinson
Antiquity.,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
WHY?,Dickinson
The murmur of a bee,Dickinson
A witchcraft yieldeth me.,Dickinson
If any ask me why,Dickinson
'T were easier to die,Dickinson
Than tell.,Dickinson
The red upon the hill,Dickinson
Taketh away my will;,Dickinson
If anybody sneer,Dickinson

Artist who drew me so,Dickinson
Must tell!,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
Perhaps you'd like to buy a flower?,Dickinson
But I could never sell.,Dickinson
If you would like to borrow,Dickinson
Until the daffodil,Dickinson
Unties her yellow bonnet,Dickinson
Beneath the village door,Dickinson
Until the bees from clover rows,Dickinson
Their hock and sherry draw,Dickinson
Why I will lend until just then,Dickinson
But not an hour more!,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
The pedigree of honey,Dickinson
Does not concern the bee;,Dickinson
A clover any time to him,Dickinson
Is aristocracy.,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
A SERVICE OF SONG.,Dickinson
Some keep the Sabbath going to church;,Dickinson
I keep it staying at home,Dickinson
With a bobolink for a chorister,Dickinson
And an orchard for a dome.,Dickinson
Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;,Dickinson
I just wear my wings,Dickinson
And instead of tolling the bell for church,Dickinson
Our little sexton sings.,Dickinson
God preaches  a noted clergyman ,Dickinson
And the sermon is never long;,Dickinson
So instead of getting to heaven at last,Dickinson
I'm going all along!,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
The bee is not afraid of me,Dickinson
I know the butterfly;,Dickinson
The pretty people in the woods,Dickinson
Receive me cordially.,Dickinson
The brooks laugh louder when I come,Dickinson
The breezes madder play.,Dickinson
Wherefore mine eyes thy silver mists?,Dickinson
Wherefore O summer's day?,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
SUMMER'S ARMIES.,Dickinson
Some rainbow coming from the fair!,Dickinson
Some vision of the world Cashmere,Dickinson
I confidently see!,Dickinson
Or else a peacock's purple train,Dickinson
Feather by feather on the plain,Dickinson
Fritters itself away!,Dickinson
The dreamy butterflies bestir,Dickinson
Lethargic pools resume the whir,Dickinson
Of last year's sundered tune.,Dickinson
From some old fortress on the sun,Dickinson
Baronial bees march one by one,Dickinson
In murmuring platoon!,Dickinson
As flakes of snow stood yesterday,Dickinson
On fence and roof and twig.,Dickinson
The orchis binds her feather on,Dickinson
For her old lover Don the Sun,Dickinson
Revisiting the bog!,Dickinson
Without commander countless still,Dickinson
The regiment of wood and hill,Dickinson
In bright detachment stand.,Dickinson
Behold! Whose multitudes are these?,Dickinson
The children of whose turbaned seas,Dickinson
Or what Circassian land?,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
THE GRASS.,Dickinson
The grass so little has to do ,Dickinson
A sphere of simple green,Dickinson
With only butterflies to brood,Dickinson
And bees to entertain,Dickinson
And stir all day to pretty tunes,Dickinson
The breezes fetch along,Dickinson
And hold the sunshine in its lap,Dickinson
And bow to everything;,Dickinson
And thread the dews all night like pearls,Dickinson
And make itself so fine ,Dickinson
A duchess were too common,Dickinson
For such a noticing.,Dickinson
And even when it dies to pass,Dickinson
In odors so divine,Dickinson
As lowly spices gone to sleep,Dickinson
Or amulets of pine.,Dickinson
And then to dwell in sovereign barns,Dickinson
And dream the days away ,Dickinson
The grass so little has to do,Dickinson
I wish I were the hay!,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
A little road not made of man,Dickinson
Enabled of the eye,Dickinson
Accessible to thill of bee,Dickinson
Or cart of butterfly.,Dickinson
If town it have beyond itself,Dickinson
'T is that I cannot say;,Dickinson
I only sigh  no vehicle,Dickinson
Bears me along that way.,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
SUMMER SHOWER.,Dickinson
A drop fell on the apple tree,Dickinson
Another on the roof;,Dickinson
A half a dozen kissed the eaves,Dickinson
And made the gables laugh.,Dickinson
A few went out to help the brook,Dickinson
That went to help the sea.,Dickinson
Myself conjectured Were they pearls,Dickinson
What necklaces could be!,Dickinson
The dust replaced in hoisted roads,Dickinson
The birds jocoser sung;,Dickinson
The sunshine threw his hat away,Dickinson
The orchards spangles hung.,Dickinson
The breezes brought dejected lutes,Dickinson
And bathed them in the glee;,Dickinson
The East put out a single flag,Dickinson
And signed the fete away.,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
PSALM OF THE DAY.,Dickinson
A something in a summer's day,Dickinson
As slow her flambeaux burn away,Dickinson
Which solemnizes me.,Dickinson
A something in a summer's noon ,Dickinson
An azure depth a wordless tune,Dickinson
Transcending ecstasy.,Dickinson
And still within a summer's night,Dickinson
A something so transporting bright,Dickinson
I clap my hands to see;,Dickinson
Then veil my too inspecting face,Dickinson
Lest such a subtle shimmering grace,Dickinson
Flutter too far for me.,Dickinson
The purple brook within the breast,Dickinson
Still chafes its narrow bed;,Dickinson
Still rears the East her amber flag,Dickinson
Guides still the sun along the crag,Dickinson
His caravan of red,Dickinson
Like flowers that heard the tale of dews,Dickinson
But never deemed the dripping prize,Dickinson
Awaited their low brows;,Dickinson
Or bees that thought the summer's name,Dickinson
Some rumor of delirium,Dickinson
No summer could for them;,Dickinson
Or Arctic creature dimly stirred,Dickinson
By tropic hint  some travelled bird,Dickinson
Imported to the wood;,Dickinson
Or wind's bright signal to the ear,Dickinson
Making that homely and severe,Dickinson
Contented known before,Dickinson
The heaven unexpected came,Dickinson
To lives that thought their worshipping,Dickinson
A too presumptuous psalm.,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
THE SEA OF SUNSET.,Dickinson
This is the land the sunset washes,Dickinson
These are the banks of the Yellow Sea;,Dickinson
Where it rose or whither it rushes,Dickinson
These are the western mystery!,Dickinson
Night after night her purple traffic,Dickinson
Strews the landing with opal bales;,Dickinson
Merchantmen poise upon horizons,Dickinson
Dip and vanish with fairy sails.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
PURPLE CLOVER.,Dickinson
There is a flower that bees prefer,Dickinson
And butterflies desire;,Dickinson
To gain the purple democrat,Dickinson
And whatsoever insect pass,Dickinson
A honey bears away,Dickinson
Proportioned to his several dearth,Dickinson
And her capacity.,Dickinson
Her face is rounder than the moon,Dickinson
And ruddier than the gown,Dickinson
Of orchis in the pasture,Dickinson
Or rhododendron worn.,Dickinson
She doth not wait for June;,Dickinson
Before the world is green,Dickinson
Her sturdy little countenance,Dickinson
Against the wind is seen,Dickinson
Contending with the grass,Dickinson
Near kinsman to herself,Dickinson
For privilege of sod and sun,Dickinson
Sweet litigants for life.,Dickinson
And when the hills are full,Dickinson
And newer fashions blow,Dickinson
Doth not retract a single spice,Dickinson
For pang of jealousy.,Dickinson
Her public is the noon,Dickinson
Her providence the sun,Dickinson
Her progress by the bee proclaimed,Dickinson
In sovereign swerveless tune.,Dickinson
The bravest of the host,Dickinson
Surrendering the last,Dickinson
Nor even of defeat aware,Dickinson
When cancelled by the frost.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
THE BEE.,Dickinson
Like trains of cars on tracks of plush,Dickinson
I hear the level bee,Dickinson
A jar across the flowers goes,Dickinson
Their velvet masonry,Dickinson
Withstands until the sweet assault,Dickinson
Their chivalry consumes,Dickinson
While he victorious tilts away,Dickinson
To vanquish other blooms.,Dickinson
His feet are shod with gauze,Dickinson
His helmet is of gold;,Dickinson
His breast a single onyx,Dickinson
With chrysoprase inlaid.,Dickinson
His labor is a chant,Dickinson
His idleness a tune;,Dickinson
Oh for a bee's experience,Dickinson
Of clovers and of noon!,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
Presentiment is that long shadow on the lawn,Dickinson
Indicative that suns go down;,Dickinson
The notice to the startled grass,Dickinson
That darkness is about to pass.,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
And then reluctant turn,Dickinson
My flowers raise their pretty lips,Dickinson
Then put their nightgowns on.,Dickinson
As children caper when they wake,Dickinson
Merry that it is morn,Dickinson
My flowers from a hundred cribs,Dickinson
Will peep and prance again.,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
Angels in the early morning,Dickinson
May be seen the dews among,Dickinson
Stooping plucking smiling flying,Dickinson
Do the buds to them belong?,Dickinson
Angels when the sun is hottest,Dickinson
May be seen the sands among,Dickinson
Stooping plucking sighing flying;,Dickinson
Parched the flowers they bear along.,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
So bashful when I spied her,Dickinson
So pretty so ashamed!,Dickinson
So hidden in her leaflets,Dickinson
Lest anybody find;,Dickinson
So breathless till I passed her,Dickinson
So helpless when I turned,Dickinson
And bore her struggling blushing,Dickinson
Her simple haunts beyond!,Dickinson
For whom I robbed the dingle,Dickinson
For whom betrayed the dell,Dickinson
Many will doubtless ask me,Dickinson
But I shall never tell!,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
TWO WORLDS.,Dickinson
It makes no difference abroad,Dickinson
The seasons fit the same,Dickinson
The mornings blossom into noons,Dickinson
And split their pods of flame.,Dickinson
The brooks brag all the day;,Dickinson
No blackbird bates his jargoning,Dickinson
For passing Calvary.,Dickinson
Are nothing to the bee;,Dickinson
His separation from his rose,Dickinson
To him seems misery.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
THE MOUNTAIN.,Dickinson
The mountain sat upon the plain,Dickinson
In his eternal chair,Dickinson
His observation omnifold,Dickinson
His inquest everywhere.,Dickinson
The seasons prayed around his knees,Dickinson
Like children round a sire,Dickinson
Grandfather of the days is he,Dickinson
Of dawn the ancestor.,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
A DAY.,Dickinson
I'll tell you how the sun rose ,Dickinson
A ribbon at a time.,Dickinson
The steeples swam in amethyst,Dickinson
The news like squirrels ran.,Dickinson
The hills untied their bonnets,Dickinson
The bobolinks begun.,Dickinson
Then I said softly to myself,Dickinson
That must have been the sun!,Dickinson
* * *,Dickinson
But how he set I know not.,Dickinson
There seemed a purple stile,Dickinson
Which little yellow boys and girls,Dickinson
Were climbing all the while,Dickinson
Till when they reached the other side,Dickinson
A dominie in gray,Dickinson
Put gently up the evening bars,Dickinson
And led the flock away.,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
In chrysoprase apartments hung,Dickinson
This afternoon put on.,Dickinson
How condescending to descend,Dickinson
And be of buttercups the friend,Dickinson
In a New England town!,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
THE WIND.,Dickinson
Of all the sounds despatched abroad,Dickinson
There's not a charge to me,Dickinson
Like that old measure in the boughs,Dickinson
That phraseless melody,Dickinson
The wind does working like a hand,Dickinson
Whose fingers brush the sky,Dickinson
Then quiver down with tufts of tune,Dickinson
Permitted gods and me.,Dickinson
When winds go round and round in bands,Dickinson
And thrum upon the door,Dickinson
And birds take places overhead,Dickinson
To bear them orchestra,Dickinson
I crave him grace of summer boughs,Dickinson
If such an outcast be,Dickinson
He never heard that fleshless chant,Dickinson
Rise solemn in the tree,Dickinson
As if some caravan of sound,Dickinson
On deserts in the sky,Dickinson
Had broken rank,Dickinson
Then knit and passed,Dickinson
In seamless company.,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
DEATH AND LIFE.,Dickinson
Apparently with no surprise,Dickinson
To any happy flower,Dickinson
The frost beheads it at its play,Dickinson
In accidental power.,Dickinson
The blond assassin passes on,Dickinson
The sun proceeds unmoved,Dickinson
To measure off another day,Dickinson
For an approving God.,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
'T was later when the summer went,Dickinson
Than when the cricket came,Dickinson
And yet we knew that gentle clock,Dickinson
Meant nought but going home.,Dickinson
'T was sooner when the cricket went,Dickinson
Than when the winter came,Dickinson
Yet that pathetic pendulum,Dickinson
Keeps esoteric time.,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
INDIAN SUMMER.,Dickinson
These are the days when birds come back,Dickinson
A very few a bird or two,Dickinson
To take a backward look.,Dickinson
These are the days when skies put on,Dickinson
The old old sophistries of June ,Dickinson
A blue and gold mistake.,Dickinson
Oh fraud that cannot cheat the bee,Dickinson
Almost thy plausibility,Dickinson
Induces my belief,Dickinson
Till ranks of seeds their witness bear,Dickinson
And softly through the altered air,Dickinson
Hurries a timid leaf!,Dickinson
Oh sacrament of summer days,Dickinson
Oh last communion in the haze,Dickinson
Permit a child to join,Dickinson
Thy sacred emblems to partake,Dickinson
Thy consecrated bread to break,Dickinson
Taste thine immortal wine!,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
AUTUMN.,Dickinson
The morns are meeker than they were,Dickinson
The nuts are getting brown;,Dickinson
The berry's cheek is plumper,Dickinson
The rose is out of town.,Dickinson
The maple wears a gayer scarf,Dickinson
The field a scarlet gown.,Dickinson
I'll put a trinket on.,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
BECLOUDED.,Dickinson
The sky is low the clouds are mean,Dickinson
A travelling flake of snow,Dickinson
Across a barn or through a rut,Dickinson
Debates if it will go.,Dickinson
A narrow wind complains all day,Dickinson
How some one treated him;,Dickinson
Nature like us is sometimes caught,Dickinson
Without her diadem.,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
THE HEMLOCK.,Dickinson
I think the hemlock likes to stand,Dickinson
Upon a marge of snow;,Dickinson
It suits his own austerity,Dickinson
And satisfies an awe,Dickinson
That men must slake in wilderness,Dickinson
Or in the desert cloy ,Dickinson
An instinct for the hoar the bald,Dickinson
Lapland's necessity.,Dickinson
The hemlock's nature thrives on cold;,Dickinson
The gnash of northern winds,Dickinson
Is sweetest nutriment to him,Dickinson
His best Norwegian wines.,Dickinson
To satin races he is nought;,Dickinson
But children on the Don,Dickinson
Beneath his tabernacles play,Dickinson
And Dnieper wrestlers run.,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
There's a certain slant of light,Dickinson
On winter afternoons,Dickinson
That oppresses like the weight,Dickinson
Of cathedral tunes.,Dickinson
Heavenly hurt it gives us;,Dickinson
We can find no scar,Dickinson
But internal difference,Dickinson
Where the meanings are.,Dickinson
None may teach it anything,Dickinson
 T is the seal despair ,Dickinson
An imperial affliction,Dickinson
Sent us of the air.,Dickinson
When it comes the landscape listens,Dickinson
Shadows hold their breath;,Dickinson
When it goes 't is like the distance,Dickinson
On the look of death.,Dickinson
IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
One dignity delays for all,Dickinson
One mitred afternoon.,Dickinson
None can avoid this purple,Dickinson
None evade this crown.,Dickinson
Coach it insures and footmen,Dickinson
Chamber and state and throng;,Dickinson
Bells also in the village,Dickinson
As we ride grand along.,Dickinson
What dignified attendants,Dickinson
What service when we pause!,Dickinson
How loyally at parting,Dickinson
Their hundred hats they raise!,Dickinson
How pomp surpassing ermine,Dickinson
When simple you and I,Dickinson
Present our meek escutcheon,Dickinson
And claim the rank to die!,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
TOO LATE.,Dickinson
Delayed till she had ceased to know,Dickinson
Delayed till in its vest of snow,Dickinson
Her loving bosom lay.,Dickinson
An hour behind the fleeting breath,Dickinson
Later by just an hour than death ,Dickinson
Oh lagging yesterday!,Dickinson
Could she have guessed that it would be;,Dickinson
Could but a crier of the glee,Dickinson
Have climbed the distant hill;,Dickinson
Had not the bliss so slow a pace ,Dickinson
Who knows but this surrendered face,Dickinson
Were undefeated still?,Dickinson
Oh if there may departing be,Dickinson
Any forgot by victory,Dickinson
In her imperial round,Dickinson
Show them this meek apparelled thing,Dickinson
That could not stop to be a king,Dickinson
Doubtful if it be crowned!,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
ASTRA CASTRA.,Dickinson
Departed to the judgment,Dickinson
A mighty afternoon;,Dickinson
Great clouds like ushers leaning,Dickinson
Creation looking on.,Dickinson
The flesh surrendered cancelled,Dickinson
The bodiless begun;,Dickinson
Two worlds like audiences disperse,Dickinson
And leave the soul alone.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
Safe in their alabaster chambers,Dickinson
Untouched by morning and untouched by noon,Dickinson
Sleep the meek members of the resurrection,Dickinson
Rafter of satin and roof of stone.,Dickinson
Light laughs the breeze in her castle of sunshine;,Dickinson
Babbles the bee in a stolid ear;,Dickinson
Pipe the sweet birds in ignorant cadence ,Dickinson
Ah what sagacity perished here!,Dickinson
Grand go the years in the crescent above them;,Dickinson
Worlds scoop their arcs and firmaments row,Dickinson
Diadems drop and Doges surrender,Dickinson
Soundless as dots on a disk of snow.,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
On this long storm the rainbow rose,Dickinson
On this late morn the sun;,Dickinson
The clouds like listless elephants,Dickinson
Horizons straggled down.,Dickinson
The birds rose smiling in their nests,Dickinson
The gales indeed were done;,Dickinson
Alas! how heedless were the eyes,Dickinson
On whom the summer shone!,Dickinson
The quiet nonchalance of death,Dickinson
No daybreak can bestir;,Dickinson
The slow archangel's syllables,Dickinson
Must awaken her.,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
FROM THE CHRYSALIS.,Dickinson
My cocoon tightens colors tease,Dickinson
I'm feeling for the air;,Dickinson
A dim capacity for wings,Dickinson
Degrades the dress I wear.,Dickinson
A power of butterfly must be,Dickinson
The aptitude to fly,Dickinson
Meadows of majesty concedes,Dickinson
And easy sweeps of sky.,Dickinson
So I must baffle at the hint,Dickinson
And cipher at the sign,Dickinson
And make much blunder if at last,Dickinson
I take the clew divine.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
SETTING SAIL.,Dickinson
Exultation is the going,Dickinson
Of an inland soul to sea ,Dickinson
Past the houses past the headlands,Dickinson
Into deep eternity!,Dickinson
Bred as we among the mountains,Dickinson
Can the sailor understand,Dickinson
The divine intoxication,Dickinson
Of the first league out from land?,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
Look back on time with kindly eyes,Dickinson
He doubtless did his best;,Dickinson
How softly sinks his trembling sun,Dickinson
In human nature's west!,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
A train went through a burial gate,Dickinson
A bird broke forth and sang,Dickinson
And trilled and quivered and shook his throat,Dickinson
Till all the churchyard rang;,Dickinson
And then adjusted his little notes,Dickinson
And bowed and sang again.,Dickinson
Doubtless he thought it meet of him,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
I died for beauty but was scarce,Dickinson
Adjusted in the tomb,Dickinson
When one who died for truth was lain,Dickinson
In an adjoining room.,Dickinson
He questioned softly why I failed?,Dickinson
For beauty I replied.,Dickinson
And so as kinsmen met a night,Dickinson
We talked between the rooms,Dickinson
Until the moss had reached our lips,Dickinson
And covered up our names.,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
TROUBLED ABOUT MANY THINGS.,Dickinson
How many times these low feet staggered,Dickinson
Only the soldered mouth can tell;,Dickinson
Try! can you stir the awful rivet?,Dickinson
Try! can you lift the hasps of steel?,Dickinson
Stroke the cool forehead hot so often,Dickinson
Lift if you can the listless hair;,Dickinson
Handle the adamantine fingers,Dickinson
Never a thimble more shall wear.,Dickinson
Buzz the dull flies on the chamber window;,Dickinson
Brave shines the sun through the freckled pane;,Dickinson
Fearless the cobweb swings from the ceiling ,Dickinson
Indolent housewife in daisies lain!,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
REAL.,Dickinson
I like a look of agony,Dickinson
Because I know it 's true;,Dickinson
Men do not sham convulsion,Dickinson
Nor simulate a throe.,Dickinson
The eyes glaze once and that is death.,Dickinson
Impossible to feign,Dickinson
The beads upon the forehead,Dickinson
By homely anguish strung.,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
THE FUNERAL.,Dickinson
That short potential stir,Dickinson
That each can make but once,Dickinson
That bustle so illustrious,Dickinson
T is almost consequence,Dickinson
Is the eclat of death.,Dickinson
Oh thou unknown renown,Dickinson
That not a beggar would accept,Dickinson
Had he the power to spurn!,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
I went to thank her,Dickinson
But she slept;,Dickinson
Her bed a funnelled stone,Dickinson
With nosegays at the head and foot,Dickinson
That travellers had thrown,Dickinson
Who went to thank her;,Dickinson
But she slept.,Dickinson
'T was short to cross the sea,Dickinson
To look upon her like alive,Dickinson
But turning back 't was slow.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
I've seen a dying eye,Dickinson
Run round and round a room,Dickinson
In search of something as it seemed,Dickinson
Then cloudier become;,Dickinson
And then obscure with fog,Dickinson
And then be soldered down,Dickinson
Without disclosing what it be,Dickinson
'T were blessed to have seen.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
REFUGE.,Dickinson
The clouds their backs together laid,Dickinson
The north begun to push,Dickinson
The forests galloped till they fell,Dickinson
The lightning skipped like mice;,Dickinson
The thunder crumbled like a stuff ,Dickinson
How good to be safe in tombs,Dickinson
Where nature's temper cannot reach,Dickinson
Nor vengeance ever comes!,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
I never saw a moor,Dickinson
I never saw the sea;,Dickinson
Yet know I how the heather looks,Dickinson
And what a wave must be.,Dickinson
I never spoke with God,Dickinson
Nor visited in heaven;,Dickinson
Yet certain am I of the spot,Dickinson
As if the chart were given.,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
PLAYMATES.,Dickinson
God permits industrious angels,Dickinson
Afternoons to play.,Dickinson
All for him straightway.,Dickinson
God calls home the angels promptly,Dickinson
At the setting sun;,Dickinson
I missed mine. How dreary marbles,Dickinson
After playing Crown!,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
To know just how he suffered would be dear;,Dickinson
To know if any human eyes were near,Dickinson
To whom he could intrust his wavering gaze,Dickinson
Until it settled firm on Paradise.,Dickinson
To know if he was patient part content,Dickinson
Was dying as he thought or different;,Dickinson
Was it a pleasant day to die,Dickinson
And did the sunshine face his way?,Dickinson
What was his furthest mind of home or God,Dickinson
Or what the distant say,Dickinson
At news that he ceased human nature,Dickinson
On such a day?,Dickinson
And wishes had he any?,Dickinson
Just his sigh accented,Dickinson
Had been legible to me.,Dickinson
And was he confident until,Dickinson
Ill fluttered out in everlasting well?,Dickinson
And if he spoke what name was best,Dickinson
What first,Dickinson
What one broke off with,Dickinson
At the drowsiest?,Dickinson
Was he afraid or tranquil?,Dickinson
Might he know,Dickinson
How conscious consciousness could grow,Dickinson
Till love that was and love too blest to be,Dickinson
Meet  and the junction be Eternity?,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
The last night that she lived,Dickinson
It was a common night,Dickinson
Except the dying; this to us,Dickinson
Made nature different.,Dickinson
We noticed smallest things ,Dickinson
Things overlooked before,Dickinson
By this great light upon our minds,Dickinson
Italicized as 't were.,Dickinson
That others could exist,Dickinson
While she must finish quite,Dickinson
A jealousy for her arose,Dickinson
So nearly infinite.,Dickinson
We waited while she passed;,Dickinson
It was a narrow time,Dickinson
Too jostled were our souls to speak,Dickinson
At length the notice came.,Dickinson
She mentioned and forgot;,Dickinson
Then lightly as a reed,Dickinson
Bent to the water shivered scarce,Dickinson
Consented and was dead.,Dickinson
And we we placed the hair,Dickinson
And drew the head erect;,Dickinson
And then an awful leisure was,Dickinson
Our faith to regulate.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
THE FIRST LESSON.,Dickinson
Not in this world to see his face,Dickinson
Sounds long until I read the place,Dickinson
Where this is said to be,Dickinson
But just the primer to a life,Dickinson
Unopened rare upon the shelf,Dickinson
Clasped yet to him and me.,Dickinson
And yet my primer suits me so,Dickinson
I would not choose a book to know,Dickinson
Than that be sweeter wise;,Dickinson
Might some one else so learned be,Dickinson
And leave me just my A B C,Dickinson
Himself could have the skies.,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
The bustle in a house,Dickinson
The morning after death,Dickinson
Is solemnest of industries,Dickinson
Enacted upon earth ,Dickinson
The sweeping up the heart,Dickinson
And putting love away,Dickinson
We shall not want to use again,Dickinson
Until eternity.,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
I reason earth is short,Dickinson
And anguish absolute,Dickinson
And many hurt;,Dickinson
But what of that?,Dickinson
I reason we could die,Dickinson
The best vitality,Dickinson
Cannot excel decay;,Dickinson
But what of that?,Dickinson
I reason that in heaven,Dickinson
Somehow it will be even,Dickinson
Some new equation given;,Dickinson
But what of that?,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
Afraid? Of whom am I afraid?,Dickinson
Not death; for who is he?,Dickinson
The porter of my father's lodge,Dickinson
As much abasheth me.,Dickinson
Of life? 'T were odd I fear a thing,Dickinson
That comprehendeth me,Dickinson
In one or more existences,Dickinson
At Deity's decree.,Dickinson
Of resurrection? Is the east,Dickinson
Afraid to trust the morn,Dickinson
With her fastidious forehead?,Dickinson
As soon impeach my crown!,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
DYING.,Dickinson
The sun kept setting setting still;,Dickinson
No hue of afternoon,Dickinson
Upon the village I perceived ,Dickinson
From house to house 't was noon.,Dickinson
The dusk kept dropping dropping still;,Dickinson
No dew upon the grass,Dickinson
But only on my forehead stopped,Dickinson
And wandered in my face.,Dickinson
My feet kept drowsing drowsing still,Dickinson
My fingers were awake;,Dickinson
Yet why so little sound myself,Dickinson
Unto my seeming make?,Dickinson
How well I knew the light before!,Dickinson
I could not see it now.,Dickinson
T is dying I am doing; but,Dickinson
I'm not afraid to know.,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
Two swimmers wrestled on the spar,Dickinson
Until the morning sun,Dickinson
When one turned smiling to the land.,Dickinson
O God the other one!,Dickinson
The stray ships passing spied a face,Dickinson
Upon the waters borne,Dickinson
With eyes in death still begging raised,Dickinson
And hands beseeching thrown.,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
THE CHARIOT.,Dickinson
Because I could not stop for Death,Dickinson
He kindly stopped for me;,Dickinson
The carriage held but just ourselves,Dickinson
And Immortality.,Dickinson
We slowly drove he knew no haste,Dickinson
And I had put away,Dickinson
My labor and my leisure too,Dickinson
For his civility.,Dickinson
We passed the school where children played,Dickinson
Their lessons scarcely done;,Dickinson
We passed the fields of gazing grain,Dickinson
We passed the setting sun.,Dickinson
We paused before a house that seemed,Dickinson
A swelling of the ground;,Dickinson
The roof was scarcely visible,Dickinson
The cornice but a mound.,Dickinson
Since then 't is centuries; but each,Dickinson
Feels shorter than the day,Dickinson
I first surmised the horses' heads,Dickinson
Were toward eternity.,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
She went as quiet as the dew,Dickinson
From a familiar flower.,Dickinson
Not like the dew did she return,Dickinson
At the accustomed hour!,Dickinson
She dropt as softly as a star,Dickinson
From out my summer's eve;,Dickinson
Less skilful than Leverrier,Dickinson
It's sorer to believe!,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
RESURGAM.,Dickinson
At last to be identified!,Dickinson
At last the lamps upon thy side,Dickinson
The rest of life to see!,Dickinson
Past midnight past the morning star!,Dickinson
Past sunrise! Ah! what leagues there are,Dickinson
Between our feet and day!,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
Except to heaven she is nought;,Dickinson
Except for angels lone;,Dickinson
A flower superfluous blown;,Dickinson
Except for winds provincial;,Dickinson
Except by butterflies,Dickinson
Unnoticed as a single dew,Dickinson
That on the acre lies.,Dickinson
The smallest housewife in the grass,Dickinson
Yet take her from the lawn,Dickinson
And somebody has lost the face,Dickinson
That made existence home!,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
Death is a dialogue between,Dickinson
The spirit and the dust.,Dickinson
Death doubts it argues from the ground.,Dickinson
The Spirit turns away,Dickinson
Just laying off for evidence,Dickinson
An overcoat of clay.,Dickinson
XXXII.,Dickinson
It was too late for man,Dickinson
But early yet for God;,Dickinson
Creation impotent to help,Dickinson
But prayer remained our side.,Dickinson
How excellent the heaven,Dickinson
When earth cannot be had;,Dickinson
How hospitable then the face,Dickinson
Of our old neighbor God!,Dickinson
XXXIII.,Dickinson
ALONG THE POTOMAC.,Dickinson
When I was small a woman died.,Dickinson
Went up from the Potomac,Dickinson
His face all victory,Dickinson
To look at her; how slowly,Dickinson
The seasons must have turned,Dickinson
Till bullets clipt an angle,Dickinson
And he passed quickly round!,Dickinson
If pride shall be in Paradise,Dickinson
I never can decide;,Dickinson
Of their imperial conduct,Dickinson
No person testified.,Dickinson
But proud in apparition,Dickinson
That woman and her boy,Dickinson
Pass back and forth before my brain,Dickinson
As ever in the sky.,Dickinson
XXXIV.,Dickinson
The daisy follows soft the sun,Dickinson
And when his golden walk is done,Dickinson
Sits shyly at his feet.,Dickinson
He waking finds the flower near.,Dickinson
Wherefore marauder art thou here?,Dickinson
Because sir love is sweet!,Dickinson
We are the flower Thou the sun!,Dickinson
Forgive us if as days decline,Dickinson
We nearer steal to Thee ,Dickinson
Enamoured of the parting west,Dickinson
The peace the flight the amethyst,Dickinson
Night's possibility!,Dickinson
XXXV.,Dickinson
EMANCIPATION.,Dickinson
No rack can torture me,Dickinson
My soul's at liberty,Dickinson
Behind this mortal bone,Dickinson
There knits a bolder one,Dickinson
You cannot prick with saw,Dickinson
Nor rend with scymitar.,Dickinson
Two bodies therefore be;,Dickinson
Bind one and one will flee.,Dickinson
The eagle of his nest,Dickinson
No easier divest,Dickinson
And gain the sky,Dickinson
Than mayest thou,Dickinson
Except thyself may be,Dickinson
Thine enemy;,Dickinson
Captivity is consciousness,Dickinson
So's liberty.,Dickinson
XXXVI.,Dickinson
LOST.,Dickinson
I lost a world the other day.,Dickinson
Has anybody found?,Dickinson
You'll know it by the row of stars,Dickinson
Around its forehead bound.,Dickinson
A rich man might not notice it;,Dickinson
Yet to my frugal eye,Dickinson
Of more esteem than ducats.,Dickinson
Oh find it sir for me!,Dickinson
XXXVII.,Dickinson
If I shouldn't be alive,Dickinson
When the robins come,Dickinson
Give the one in red cravat,Dickinson
A memorial crumb.,Dickinson
If I couldn't thank you,Dickinson
Being just asleep,Dickinson
You will know I'm trying,Dickinson
With my granite lip!,Dickinson
XXXVIII.,Dickinson
Sleep is supposed to be,Dickinson
By souls of sanity,Dickinson
The shutting of the eye.,Dickinson
Sleep is the station grand,Dickinson
Down which on either hand,Dickinson
The hosts of witness stand!,Dickinson
Morn is supposed to be,Dickinson
By people of degree,Dickinson
The breaking of the day.,Dickinson
Morning has not occurred!,Dickinson
That shall aurora be,Dickinson
East of eternity;,Dickinson
One with the banner gay,Dickinson
One in the red array ,Dickinson
That is the break of day.,Dickinson
XXXIX.,Dickinson
I shall know why when time is over,Dickinson
And I have ceased to wonder why;,Dickinson
Christ will explain each separate anguish,Dickinson
In the fair schoolroom of the sky.,Dickinson
He will tell me what Peter promised,Dickinson
And I for wonder at his woe,Dickinson
I shall forget the drop of anguish,Dickinson
That scalds me now that scalds me now.,Dickinson
XL.,Dickinson
I never lost as much but twice,Dickinson
And that was in the sod;,Dickinson
Twice have I stood a beggar,Dickinson
Before the door of God!,Dickinson
Angels twice descending,Dickinson
Reimbursed my store.,Dickinson
Burglar banker father,Dickinson
I am poor once more!,Dickinson
POEMS,Dickinson
by EMILY DICKINSON,Dickinson
Second Series,Dickinson
Edited by two of her friends,Dickinson
MABEL LOOMIS TODD and T.W. HIGGINSON,Dickinson
PREFACE,Dickinson
Although Emily Dickinson had been in the habit of sending occasional poems to friends and correspondents the full extent of her writing was by no means imagined by them. Her friend H.H. must at least have suspected it for in a letter dated 5th September 1884 she wrote,Dickinson
Truly yours,Dickinson
HELEN JACKSON.,Dickinson
The variation of readings with the fact that she often wrote in pencil and not always clearly have at times thrown a good deal of responsibility upon her Editors. But all interference not absolutely inevitable has been avoided. The very roughness of her rendering is part of herself and not lightly to be touched; for it seems in many cases that she intentionally avoided the smoother and more usual rhymes.,Dickinson
Storm wind the wild March sky sunsets and dawns; the birds and bees butterflies and flowers of her garden with a few trusted human friends were sufficient companionship. The coming of the first robin was a jubilee beyond crowning of monarch or birthday of pope; the first red leaf hurrying through the altered air an epoch. Immortality was close about her; and while never morbid or melancholy she lived in its presence.,Dickinson
MABEL LOOMIS TODD.,Dickinson
AMHERST MASSACHUSETTS,Dickinson
August 1891.,Dickinson
My nosegays are for captives;,Dickinson
Fingers denied the plucking,Dickinson
Patient till paradise,Dickinson
To such if they should whisper,Dickinson
Of morning and the moor,Dickinson
They bear no other errand,Dickinson
And I no other prayer.,Dickinson
I. LIFE.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
I'm nobody! Who are you?,Dickinson
Are you nobody too?,Dickinson
Then there 's a pair of us  don't tell!,Dickinson
They 'd banish us you know.,Dickinson
How dreary to be somebody!,Dickinson
How public like a frog,Dickinson
To tell your name the livelong day,Dickinson
To an admiring bog!,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
I bring an unaccustomed wine,Dickinson
To lips long parching next to mine,Dickinson
And summon them to drink.,Dickinson
Crackling with fever they essay;,Dickinson
I turn my brimming eyes away,Dickinson
And come next hour to look.,Dickinson
The hands still hug the tardy glass;,Dickinson
The lips I would have cooled alas!,Dickinson
Are so superfluous cold,Dickinson
I would as soon attempt to warm,Dickinson
The bosoms where the frost has lain,Dickinson
Ages beneath the mould.,Dickinson
Some other thirsty there may be,Dickinson
To whom this would have pointed me,Dickinson
Had it remained to speak.,Dickinson
And so I always bear the cup,Dickinson
If haply mine may be the drop,Dickinson
Some pilgrim thirst to slake ,Dickinson
If haply any say to me,Dickinson
Unto the little unto me,Dickinson
When I at last awake.,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
The nearest dream recedes unrealized.,Dickinson
The heaven we chase,Dickinson
Like the June bee,Dickinson
Invites the race;,Dickinson
Stoops to an easy clover ,Dickinson
Dips  evades  teases  deploys;,Dickinson
Then to the royal clouds,Dickinson
Lifts his light pinnace,Dickinson
Heedless of the boy,Dickinson
Staring bewildered at the mocking sky.,Dickinson
Homesick for steadfast honey,Dickinson
Ah! the bee flies not,Dickinson
That brews that rare variety.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
We play at paste,Dickinson
Till qualified for pearl,Dickinson
Then drop the paste,Dickinson
And deem ourself a fool.,Dickinson
The shapes though were similar,Dickinson
And our new hands,Dickinson
Practising sands.,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
I found the phrase to every thought,Dickinson
I ever had but one;,Dickinson
And that defies me  as a hand,Dickinson
Did try to chalk the sun,Dickinson
To races nurtured in the dark; ,Dickinson
How would your own begin?,Dickinson
Can blaze be done in cochineal,Dickinson
Or noon in mazarin?,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
HOPE.,Dickinson
Hope is the thing with feathers,Dickinson
That perches in the soul,Dickinson
And sings the tune without the words,Dickinson
And never stops at all,Dickinson
And sweetest in the gale is heard;,Dickinson
And sore must be the storm,Dickinson
That could abash the little bird,Dickinson
That kept so many warm.,Dickinson
I 've heard it in the chillest land,Dickinson
And on the strangest sea;,Dickinson
Yet never in extremity,Dickinson
It asked a crumb of me.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
THE WHITE HEAT.,Dickinson
Dare you see a soul at the white heat?,Dickinson
Then crouch within the door.,Dickinson
Red is the fire's common tint;,Dickinson
But when the vivid ore,Dickinson
Has sated flame's conditions,Dickinson
Its quivering substance plays,Dickinson
Without a color but the light,Dickinson
Of unanointed blaze.,Dickinson
Least village boasts its blacksmith,Dickinson
Whose anvil's even din,Dickinson
Stands symbol for the finer forge,Dickinson
That soundless tugs within,Dickinson
Refining these impatient ores,Dickinson
With hammer and with blaze,Dickinson
Until the designated light,Dickinson
Repudiate the forge.,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
TRIUMPHANT.,Dickinson
Who never lost are unprepared,Dickinson
A coronet to find;,Dickinson
Who never thirsted flagons,Dickinson
And cooling tamarind.,Dickinson
Who never climbed the weary league ,Dickinson
Can such a foot explore,Dickinson
The purple territories,Dickinson
On Pizarro's shore?,Dickinson
How many legions overcome?,Dickinson
The emperor will say.,Dickinson
How many colors taken,Dickinson
On Revolution Day?,Dickinson
How many bullets bearest?,Dickinson
The royal scar hast thou?,Dickinson
Angels write Promoted,Dickinson
On this soldier's brow!,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
THE TEST.,Dickinson
I can wade grief,Dickinson
Whole pools of it ,Dickinson
I 'm used to that.,Dickinson
But the least push of joy,Dickinson
Breaks up my feet,Dickinson
And I tip  drunken.,Dickinson
Let no pebble smile,Dickinson
T was the new liquor ,Dickinson
That was all!,Dickinson
Power is only pain,Dickinson
Stranded through discipline,Dickinson
Till weights will hang.,Dickinson
Give balm to giants,Dickinson
And they 'll wilt like men.,Dickinson
Give Himmaleh ,Dickinson
They 'll carry him!,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
ESCAPE.,Dickinson
I never hear the word escape,Dickinson
Without a quicker blood,Dickinson
A sudden expectation,Dickinson
A flying attitude.,Dickinson
I never hear of prisons broad,Dickinson
By soldiers battered down,Dickinson
But I tug childish at my bars ,Dickinson
Only to fail again!,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
COMPENSATION.,Dickinson
For each ecstatic instant,Dickinson
We must an anguish pay,Dickinson
In keen and quivering ratio,Dickinson
To the ecstasy.,Dickinson
For each beloved hour,Dickinson
Sharp pittances of years,Dickinson
Bitter contested farthings,Dickinson
And coffers heaped with tears.,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
THE MARTYRS.,Dickinson
Through the straight pass of suffering,Dickinson
The martyrs even trod,Dickinson
Their feet upon temptation,Dickinson
Their faces upon God.,Dickinson
A stately shriven company;,Dickinson
Convulsion playing round,Dickinson
Harmless as streaks of meteor,Dickinson
Upon a planet's bound.,Dickinson
Their faith the everlasting troth;,Dickinson
Their expectation fair;,Dickinson
The needle to the north degree,Dickinson
Wades so through polar air.,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
A PRAYER.,Dickinson
I meant to have but modest needs,Dickinson
Such as content and heaven;,Dickinson
Within my income these could lie,Dickinson
And life and I keep even.,Dickinson
But since the last included both,Dickinson
It would suffice my prayer,Dickinson
But just for one to stipulate,Dickinson
And grace would grant the pair.,Dickinson
And so upon this wise I prayed ,Dickinson
Great Spirit give to me,Dickinson
A heaven not so large as yours,Dickinson
But large enough for me.,Dickinson
A smile suffused Jehovah's face;,Dickinson
The cherubim withdrew;,Dickinson
Grave saints stole out to look at me,Dickinson
And showed their dimples too.,Dickinson
I left the place with all my might ,Dickinson
My prayer away I threw;,Dickinson
The quiet ages picked it up,Dickinson
And Judgment twinkled too,Dickinson
That one so honest be extant,Dickinson
As take the tale for true,Dickinson
But I grown shrewder scan the skies,Dickinson
With a suspicious air ,Dickinson
As children swindled for the first,Dickinson
All swindlers be infer.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
The thought beneath so slight a film,Dickinson
Is more distinctly seen ,Dickinson
As laces just reveal the surge,Dickinson
Or mists the Apennine.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
The soul unto itself,Dickinson
Is an imperial friend ,Dickinson
Or the most agonizing spy,Dickinson
An enemy could send.,Dickinson
Secure against its own,Dickinson
No treason it can fear;,Dickinson
Itself its sovereign of itself,Dickinson
The soul should stand in awe.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
Surgeons must be very careful,Dickinson
When they take the knife!,Dickinson
Underneath their fine incisions,Dickinson
Stirs the culprit  Life!,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
THE RAILWAY TRAIN.,Dickinson
I like to see it lap the miles,Dickinson
And lick the valleys up,Dickinson
And stop to feed itself at tanks;,Dickinson
And then prodigious step,Dickinson
Around a pile of mountains,Dickinson
And supercilious peer,Dickinson
In shanties by the sides of roads;,Dickinson
And then a quarry pare,Dickinson
To fit its sides and crawl between,Dickinson
Complaining all the while,Dickinson
In horrid hooting stanza;,Dickinson
Then chase itself down hill,Dickinson
And neigh like Boanerges;,Dickinson
Then punctual as a star,Dickinson
Stop  docile and omnipotent ,Dickinson
At its own stable door.,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
THE SHOW.,Dickinson
The show is not the show,Dickinson
But they that go.,Dickinson
Menagerie to me,Dickinson
My neighbor be.,Dickinson
Fair play ,Dickinson
Both went to see.,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
Delight becomes pictorial,Dickinson
When viewed through pain ,Dickinson
More fair because impossible,Dickinson
That any gain.,Dickinson
The mountain at a given distance,Dickinson
In amber lies;,Dickinson
Approached the amber flits a little ,Dickinson
And that 's the skies!,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
That I have had before,Dickinson
But did not finish  some way back,Dickinson
I could not fix the year,Dickinson
Nor where it went nor why it came,Dickinson
The second time to me,Dickinson
Nor definitely what it was,Dickinson
Have I the art to say.,Dickinson
But somewhere in my soul I know,Dickinson
I 've met the thing before;,Dickinson
It just reminded me  't was all ,Dickinson
And came my way no more.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
Is Heaven a physician?,Dickinson
They say that He can heal;,Dickinson
But medicine posthumous,Dickinson
Is unavailable.,Dickinson
Is Heaven an exchequer?,Dickinson
They speak of what we owe;,Dickinson
But that negotiation,Dickinson
I 'm not a party to.,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
THE RETURN.,Dickinson
Though I get home how late how late!,Dickinson
So I get home 't will compensate.,Dickinson
Better will be the ecstasy,Dickinson
That they have done expecting me,Dickinson
When night descending dumb and dark,Dickinson
They hear my unexpected knock.,Dickinson
Transporting must the moment be,Dickinson
Brewed from decades of agony!,Dickinson
To think just how the fire will burn,Dickinson
To wonder what myself will say,Dickinson
And what itself will say to me,Dickinson
Beguiles the centuries of way!,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
A poor torn heart a tattered heart,Dickinson
That sat it down to rest,Dickinson
Nor noticed that the ebbing day,Dickinson
Flowed silver to the west,Dickinson
Nor noticed night did soft descend,Dickinson
Nor constellation burn,Dickinson
Intent upon the vision,Dickinson
Of latitudes unknown.,Dickinson
The angels happening that way,Dickinson
This dusty heart espied;,Dickinson
Tenderly took it up from toil,Dickinson
And carried it to God.,Dickinson
There  sandals for the barefoot;,Dickinson
There  gathered from the gales,Dickinson
Do the blue havens by the hand,Dickinson
Lead the wandering sails.,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
TOO MUCH.,Dickinson
I should have been too glad I see,Dickinson
Too lifted for the scant degree,Dickinson
Of life's penurious round;,Dickinson
My little circuit would have shamed,Dickinson
This new circumference have blamed,Dickinson
The homelier time behind.,Dickinson
I should have been too saved I see,Dickinson
Too rescued; fear too dim to me,Dickinson
That I could spell the prayer,Dickinson
I knew so perfect yesterday ,Dickinson
That scalding one Sabachthani,Dickinson
Recited fluent here.,Dickinson
Earth would have been too much I see,Dickinson
And heaven not enough for me;,Dickinson
I should have had the joy,Dickinson
Without the fear to justify ,Dickinson
The palm without the Calvary;,Dickinson
So Saviour crucify.,Dickinson
Defeat whets victory they say;,Dickinson
The reefs in old Gethsemane,Dickinson
Endear the shore beyond.,Dickinson
'T is beggars banquets best define;,Dickinson
T is thirsting vitalizes wine ,Dickinson
Faith faints to understand.,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
SHIPWRECK.,Dickinson
It tossed and tossed ,Dickinson
A little brig I knew ,Dickinson
O'ertook by blast,Dickinson
It spun and spun,Dickinson
And groped delirious for morn.,Dickinson
It slipped and slipped,Dickinson
As one that drunken stepped;,Dickinson
Its white foot tripped,Dickinson
Then dropped from sight.,Dickinson
To crew and you;,Dickinson
The ocean's heart too smooth too blue,Dickinson
To break for you.,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
Victory comes late,Dickinson
And is held low to freezing lips,Dickinson
Too rapt with frost,Dickinson
To take it.,Dickinson
How sweet it would have tasted,Dickinson
Just a drop!,Dickinson
Was God so economical?,Dickinson
His table 's spread too high for us,Dickinson
Crumbs fit such little mouths,Dickinson
Cherries suit robins;,Dickinson
The eagle's golden breakfast,Dickinson
Strangles them.,Dickinson
God keeps his oath to sparrows,Dickinson
Who of little love,Dickinson
Know how to starve!,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
ENOUGH.,Dickinson
God gave a loaf to every bird,Dickinson
But just a crumb to me;,Dickinson
I dare not eat it though I starve ,Dickinson
My poignant luxury,Dickinson
To own it touch it prove the feat,Dickinson
That made the pellet mine ,Dickinson
Too happy in my sparrow chance,Dickinson
For ampler coveting.,Dickinson
It might be famine all around,Dickinson
I could not miss an ear,Dickinson
Such plenty smiles upon my board,Dickinson
My garner shows so fair.,Dickinson
I wonder how the rich may feel ,Dickinson
An Indiaman  an Earl?,Dickinson
I deem that I with but a crumb,Dickinson
Am sovereign of them all.,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
Experiment to me,Dickinson
Is every one I meet.,Dickinson
If it contain a kernel?,Dickinson
The figure of a nut,Dickinson
Presents upon a tree,Dickinson
Equally plausibly;,Dickinson
But meat within is requisite,Dickinson
To squirrels and to me.,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
MY COUNTRY'S WARDROBE.,Dickinson
My country need not change her gown,Dickinson
Her triple suit as sweet,Dickinson
As when 't was cut at Lexington,Dickinson
And first pronounced a fit.,Dickinson
Great Britain disapproves the stars;,Dickinson
Disparagement discreet ,Dickinson
There 's something in their attitude,Dickinson
That taunts her bayonet.,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
Faith is a fine invention,Dickinson
For gentlemen who see;,Dickinson
But microscopes are prudent,Dickinson
In an emergency!,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
Except the heaven had come so near,Dickinson
So seemed to choose my door,Dickinson
The distance would not haunt me so;,Dickinson
I had not hoped before.,Dickinson
But just to hear the grace depart,Dickinson
I never thought to see,Dickinson
Afflicts me with a double loss;,Dickinson
T is lost and lost to me.,Dickinson
XXXII.,Dickinson
Portraits are to daily faces,Dickinson
As an evening west,Dickinson
To a fine pedantic sunshine,Dickinson
In a satin vest.,Dickinson
XXXIII.,Dickinson
THE DUEL.,Dickinson
I took my power in my hand.,Dickinson
And went against the world;,Dickinson
T was not so much as David had,Dickinson
But I was twice as bold.,Dickinson
I aimed my pebble but myself,Dickinson
Was all the one that fell.,Dickinson
Was it Goliath was too large,Dickinson
Or only I too small?,Dickinson
XXXIV.,Dickinson
A shady friend for torrid days,Dickinson
Is easier to find,Dickinson
Than one of higher temperature,Dickinson
For frigid hour of mind.,Dickinson
The vane a little to the east,Dickinson
Scares muslin souls away;,Dickinson
If broadcloth breasts are firmer,Dickinson
Than those of organdy,Dickinson
Who is to blame? The weaver?,Dickinson
Ah! the bewildering thread!,Dickinson
The tapestries of paradise,Dickinson
So notelessly are made!,Dickinson
XXXV.,Dickinson
THE GOAL.,Dickinson
Each life converges to some centre,Dickinson
Expressed or still;,Dickinson
Exists in every human nature,Dickinson
A goal,Dickinson
Admitted scarcely to itself it may be,Dickinson
Too fair,Dickinson
For credibility's temerity,Dickinson
To dare.,Dickinson
Adored with caution as a brittle heaven,Dickinson
To reach,Dickinson
Were hopeless as the rainbow's raiment,Dickinson
To touch,Dickinson
Yet persevered toward surer for the distance;,Dickinson
How high,Dickinson
Unto the saints' slow diligence,Dickinson
The sky!,Dickinson
Ungained it may be by a life's low venture,Dickinson
But then,Dickinson
Eternity enables the endeavoring,Dickinson
Again.,Dickinson
XXXVI.,Dickinson
SIGHT.,Dickinson
Before I got my eye put out,Dickinson
I liked as well to see,Dickinson
As other creatures that have eyes,Dickinson
And know no other way.,Dickinson
That I might have the sky,Dickinson
For mine I tell you that my heart,Dickinson
Would split for size of me.,Dickinson
The meadows mine the mountains mine ,Dickinson
All forests stintless stars,Dickinson
As much of noon as I could take,Dickinson
Between my finite eyes.,Dickinson
The motions of the dipping birds,Dickinson
The lightning's jointed road,Dickinson
For mine to look at when I liked ,Dickinson
The news would strike me dead!,Dickinson
So safer guess with just my soul,Dickinson
Where other creatures put their eyes,Dickinson
Incautious of the sun.,Dickinson
XXXVII.,Dickinson
Talk with prudence to a beggar,Dickinson
Of 'Potosi' and the mines!,Dickinson
Reverently to the hungry,Dickinson
Of your viands and your wines!,Dickinson
Cautious hint to any captive,Dickinson
You have passed enfranchised feet!,Dickinson
Anecdotes of air in dungeons,Dickinson
Have sometimes proved deadly sweet!,Dickinson
XXXVIII.,Dickinson
THE PREACHER.,Dickinson
He preached upon breadth till it argued him narrow ,Dickinson
The broad are too broad to define;,Dickinson
And of truth until it proclaimed him a liar ,Dickinson
The truth never flaunted a sign.,Dickinson
Simplicity fled from his counterfeit presence,Dickinson
As gold the pyrites would shun.,Dickinson
What confusion would cover the innocent Jesus,Dickinson
To meet so enabled a man!,Dickinson
XXXIX.,Dickinson
Good night! which put the candle out?,Dickinson
A jealous zephyr not a doubt.,Dickinson
Ah! friend you little knew,Dickinson
How long at that celestial wick,Dickinson
The angels labored diligent;,Dickinson
Extinguished now for you!,Dickinson
It might have been the lighthouse spark,Dickinson
Some sailor rowing in the dark,Dickinson
Had importuned to see!,Dickinson
It might have been the waning lamp,Dickinson
That lit the drummer from the camp,Dickinson
To purer reveille!,Dickinson
XL.,Dickinson
When I hoped I feared,Dickinson
Since I hoped I dared;,Dickinson
Everywhere alone,Dickinson
As a church remain;,Dickinson
Spectre cannot harm,Dickinson
Serpent cannot charm;,Dickinson
He deposes doom,Dickinson
Who hath suffered him.,Dickinson
XLI.,Dickinson
DEED.,Dickinson
A deed knocks first at thought,Dickinson
And then it knocks at will.,Dickinson
That is the manufacturing spot,Dickinson
And will at home and well.,Dickinson
It then goes out an act,Dickinson
Or is entombed so still,Dickinson
That only to the ear of God,Dickinson
Its doom is audible.,Dickinson
XLII.,Dickinson
TIME'S LESSON.,Dickinson
Mine enemy is growing old ,Dickinson
I have at last revenge.,Dickinson
The palate of the hate departs;,Dickinson
If any would avenge ,Dickinson
Let him be quick the viand flits,Dickinson
It is a faded meat.,Dickinson
Anger as soon as fed is dead;,Dickinson
'T is starving makes it fat.,Dickinson
XLIII.,Dickinson
REMORSE.,Dickinson
Remorse is memory awake,Dickinson
Her companies astir ,Dickinson
A presence of departed acts,Dickinson
At window and at door.,Dickinson
It's past set down before the soul,Dickinson
And lighted with a match,Dickinson
Perusal to facilitate,Dickinson
Of its condensed despatch.,Dickinson
Remorse is cureless  the disease,Dickinson
Not even God can heal;,Dickinson
For 't is his institution ,Dickinson
The complement of hell.,Dickinson
XLIV.,Dickinson
THE SHELTER.,Dickinson
The body grows outside ,Dickinson
The more convenient way ,Dickinson
That if the spirit like to hide,Dickinson
Its temple stands alway,Dickinson
Ajar secure inviting;,Dickinson
It never did betray,Dickinson
The soul that asked its shelter,Dickinson
In timid honesty.,Dickinson
XLV.,Dickinson
Undue significance a starving man attaches,Dickinson
To food,Dickinson
Far off; he sighs and therefore hopeless,Dickinson
And therefore good.,Dickinson
Partaken it relieves indeed but proves us,Dickinson
That spices fly,Dickinson
In the receipt. It was the distance,Dickinson
Was savory.,Dickinson
XLVI.,Dickinson
Heart not so heavy as mine,Dickinson
Wending late home,Dickinson
As it passed my window,Dickinson
Whistled itself a tune ,Dickinson
A careless snatch a ballad,Dickinson
A ditty of the street;,Dickinson
Yet to my irritated ear,Dickinson
An anodyne so sweet,Dickinson
It was as if a bobolink,Dickinson
Sauntering this way,Dickinson
Carolled and mused and carolled,Dickinson
Then bubbled slow away.,Dickinson
It was as if a chirping brook,Dickinson
Upon a toilsome way,Dickinson
Set bleeding feet to minuets,Dickinson
Without the knowing why.,Dickinson
Weary perhaps and sore.,Dickinson
Ah bugle by my window,Dickinson
I pray you stroll once more!,Dickinson
XLVII.,Dickinson
I many times thought peace had come,Dickinson
When peace was far away;,Dickinson
As wrecked men deem they sight the land,Dickinson
At centre of the sea,Dickinson
And struggle slacker but to prove,Dickinson
As hopelessly as I,Dickinson
How many the fictitious shores,Dickinson
Before the harbor lie.,Dickinson
XLVIII.,Dickinson
Unto my books so good to turn,Dickinson
Far ends of tired days;,Dickinson
It half endears the abstinence,Dickinson
And pain is missed in praise.,Dickinson
As flavors cheer retarded guests,Dickinson
With banquetings to be,Dickinson
So spices stimulate the time,Dickinson
Till my small library.,Dickinson
It may be wilderness without,Dickinson
Far feet of failing men,Dickinson
But holiday excludes the night,Dickinson
And it is bells within.,Dickinson
I thank these kinsmen of the shelf;,Dickinson
Their countenances bland,Dickinson
Enamour in prospective,Dickinson
And satisfy obtained.,Dickinson
XLIX.,Dickinson
This merit hath the worst ,Dickinson
It cannot be again.,Dickinson
When Fate hath taunted last,Dickinson
And thrown her furthest stone,Dickinson
The maimed may pause and breathe,Dickinson
And glance securely round.,Dickinson
The deer invites no longer,Dickinson
Than it eludes the hound.,Dickinson
L.,Dickinson
HUNGER.,Dickinson
I had been hungry all the years;,Dickinson
My noon had come to dine;,Dickinson
I trembling drew the table near,Dickinson
And touched the curious wine.,Dickinson
T was this on tables I had seen,Dickinson
When turning hungry lone,Dickinson
I looked in windows for the wealth,Dickinson
I could not hope to own.,Dickinson
I did not know the ample bread,Dickinson
'T was so unlike the crumb,Dickinson
The birds and I had often shared,Dickinson
The plenty hurt me 't was so new ,Dickinson
Myself felt ill and odd,Dickinson
As berry of a mountain bush,Dickinson
Transplanted to the road.,Dickinson
Nor was I hungry; so I found,Dickinson
That hunger was a way,Dickinson
Of persons outside windows,Dickinson
The entering takes away.,Dickinson
LI.,Dickinson
I gained it so,Dickinson
By climbing slow,Dickinson
By catching at the twigs that grow,Dickinson
Between the bliss and me.,Dickinson
It hung so high,Dickinson
As well the sky,Dickinson
Attempt by strategy.,Dickinson
I said I gained it ,Dickinson
This was all.,Dickinson
Look how I clutch it,Dickinson
Lest it fall,Dickinson
And I a pauper go;,Dickinson
Unfitted by an instant's grace,Dickinson
For the contented beggar's face,Dickinson
I wore an hour ago.,Dickinson
LII.,Dickinson
To learn the transport by the pain,Dickinson
As blind men learn the sun;,Dickinson
To die of thirst suspecting,Dickinson
That brooks in meadows run;,Dickinson
To stay the homesick homesick feet,Dickinson
Upon a foreign shore,Dickinson
Haunted by native lands the while,Dickinson
And blue beloved air ,Dickinson
This is the sovereign anguish,Dickinson
This the signal woe!,Dickinson
These are the patient laureates,Dickinson
Whose voices trained below,Dickinson
Ascend in ceaseless carol,Dickinson
Inaudible indeed,Dickinson
To us the duller scholars,Dickinson
Of the mysterious bard!,Dickinson
LIII.,Dickinson
RETURNING.,Dickinson
I years had been from home,Dickinson
And now before the door,Dickinson
I dared not open lest a face,Dickinson
I never saw before,Dickinson
Stare vacant into mine,Dickinson
And ask my business there.,Dickinson
My business  just a life I left,Dickinson
Was such still dwelling there?,Dickinson
I fumbled at my nerve,Dickinson
I scanned the windows near;,Dickinson
The silence like an ocean rolled,Dickinson
And broke against my ear.,Dickinson
I laughed a wooden laugh,Dickinson
That I could fear a door,Dickinson
Who danger and the dead had faced,Dickinson
But never quaked before.,Dickinson
I fitted to the latch,Dickinson
My hand with trembling care,Dickinson
Lest back the awful door should spring,Dickinson
And leave me standing there.,Dickinson
I moved my fingers off,Dickinson
As cautiously as glass,Dickinson
And held my ears and like a thief,Dickinson
Fled gasping from the house.,Dickinson
LIV.,Dickinson
PRAYER.,Dickinson
Prayer is the little implement,Dickinson
Through which men reach,Dickinson
Where presence is denied them.,Dickinson
They fling their speech,Dickinson
By means of it in God's ear;,Dickinson
If then He hear,Dickinson
This sums the apparatus,Dickinson
Comprised in prayer.,Dickinson
LV.,Dickinson
I know that he exists,Dickinson
Somewhere in silence.,Dickinson
He has hid his rare life,Dickinson
From our gross eyes.,Dickinson
T is an instant's play,Dickinson
T is a fond ambush,Dickinson
Just to make bliss,Dickinson
Earn her own surprise!,Dickinson
But should the play,Dickinson
Prove piercing earnest,Dickinson
Should the glee glaze,Dickinson
In death's stiff stare,Dickinson
Would not the fun,Dickinson
Look too expensive?,Dickinson
Would not the jest,Dickinson
Have crawled too far?,Dickinson
LVI.,Dickinson
MELODIES UNHEARD.,Dickinson
Musicians wrestle everywhere,Dickinson
All day among the crowded air,Dickinson
I hear the silver strife;,Dickinson
And  waking long before the dawn ,Dickinson
Such transport breaks upon the town,Dickinson
I think it that new life!,Dickinson
It is not bird it has no nest;,Dickinson
Nor band in brass and scarlet dressed,Dickinson
Nor tambourine nor man;,Dickinson
It is not hymn from pulpit read ,Dickinson
The morning stars the treble led,Dickinson
On time's first afternoon!,Dickinson
Some say it is the spheres at play!,Dickinson
Some say that bright majority,Dickinson
Of vanished dames and men!,Dickinson
Some think it service in the place,Dickinson
Where we with late celestial face,Dickinson
Please God shall ascertain!,Dickinson
LVII.,Dickinson
CALLED BACK.,Dickinson
Just lost when I was saved!,Dickinson
Just felt the world go by!,Dickinson
Just girt me for the onset with eternity,Dickinson
When breath blew back,Dickinson
And on the other side,Dickinson
I heard recede the disappointed tide!,Dickinson
Therefore as one returned I feel,Dickinson
Odd secrets of the line to tell!,Dickinson
Some sailor skirting foreign shores,Dickinson
Some pale reporter from the awful doors,Dickinson
Before the seal!,Dickinson
Next time to stay!,Dickinson
Next time the things to see,Dickinson
By ear unheard,Dickinson
Unscrutinized by eye.,Dickinson
Next time to tarry,Dickinson
While the ages steal ,Dickinson
Slow tramp the centuries,Dickinson
And the cycles wheel.,Dickinson
II. LOVE.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
CHOICE.,Dickinson
Of all the souls that stand create,Dickinson
I have elected one.,Dickinson
When sense from spirit files away,Dickinson
And subterfuge is done;,Dickinson
When that which is and that which was,Dickinson
Apart intrinsic stand,Dickinson
And this brief tragedy of flesh,Dickinson
Is shifted like a sand;,Dickinson
When figures show their royal front,Dickinson
And mists are carved away ,Dickinson
Behold the atom I preferred,Dickinson
To all the lists of clay!,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
I have no life but this,Dickinson
To lead it here;,Dickinson
Nor any death but lest,Dickinson
Dispelled from there;,Dickinson
Nor tie to earths to come,Dickinson
Nor action new,Dickinson
Except through this extent,Dickinson
The realm of you.,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
Your riches taught me poverty.,Dickinson
Myself a millionnaire,Dickinson
In little wealths  as girls could boast ,Dickinson
Till broad as Buenos Ayre,Dickinson
You drifted your dominions,Dickinson
A different Peru;,Dickinson
And I esteemed all poverty,Dickinson
For life's estate with you.,Dickinson
Of mines I little know myself,Dickinson
But just the names of gems ,Dickinson
The colors of the commonest;,Dickinson
And scarce of diadems,Dickinson
So much that did I meet the queen,Dickinson
Her glory I should know,Dickinson
But this must be a different wealth,Dickinson
To miss it beggars so.,Dickinson
I 'm sure 't is India all day,Dickinson
To those who look on you,Dickinson
Without a stint without a blame ,Dickinson
Might I but be the Jew!,Dickinson
I 'm sure it is Golconda,Dickinson
Beyond my power to deem ,Dickinson
To have a smile for mine each day,Dickinson
How better than a gem!,Dickinson
At least it solaces to know,Dickinson
That there exists a gold,Dickinson
Although I prove it just in time,Dickinson
Its distance to behold!,Dickinson
It 's far far treasure to surmise,Dickinson
And estimate the pearl,Dickinson
That slipped my simple fingers through,Dickinson
While just a girl at school!,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
THE CONTRACT.,Dickinson
I gave myself to him,Dickinson
And took himself for pay.,Dickinson
The solemn contract of a life,Dickinson
Was ratified this way.,Dickinson
The wealth might disappoint,Dickinson
Myself a poorer prove,Dickinson
Than this great purchaser suspect,Dickinson
The daily own of Love,Dickinson
Depreciate the vision;,Dickinson
But till the merchant buy,Dickinson
Still fable in the isles of spice,Dickinson
The subtle cargoes lie.,Dickinson
At least 't is mutual risk ,Dickinson
Some found it mutual gain;,Dickinson
Sweet debt of Life  each night to owe,Dickinson
Insolvent every noon.,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
THE LETTER.,Dickinson
You guessed from the way the sentence toiled;,Dickinson
You could hear the bodice tug behind you,Dickinson
As if it held but the might of a child;,Dickinson
You almost pitied it you it worked so.,Dickinson
Tell him  No you may quibble there,Dickinson
For it would split his heart to know it,Dickinson
And then you and I were silenter.,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
The way I read a letter 's this,Dickinson
T is first I lock the door,Dickinson
And push it with my fingers next,Dickinson
For transport it be sure.,Dickinson
And then I go the furthest off,Dickinson
To counteract a knock;,Dickinson
Then draw my little letter forth,Dickinson
And softly pick its lock.,Dickinson
Then glancing narrow at the wall,Dickinson
And narrow at the floor,Dickinson
For firm conviction of a mouse,Dickinson
Not exorcised before,Dickinson
Peruse how infinite I am,Dickinson
To  no one that you know!,Dickinson
And sigh for lack of heaven  but not,Dickinson
The heaven the creeds bestow.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
Wild nights! Wild nights!,Dickinson
Were I with thee,Dickinson
Wild nights should be,Dickinson
Our luxury!,Dickinson
Futile the winds,Dickinson
To a heart in port ,Dickinson
Done with the compass,Dickinson
Done with the chart.,Dickinson
Rowing in Eden!,Dickinson
Ah! the sea!,Dickinson
Might I but moor,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
AT HOME.,Dickinson
The night was wide and furnished scant,Dickinson
With but a single star,Dickinson
That often as a cloud it met,Dickinson
Blew out itself for fear.,Dickinson
The wind pursued the little bush,Dickinson
And drove away the leaves,Dickinson
November left; then clambered up,Dickinson
And fretted in the eaves.,Dickinson
No squirrel went abroad;,Dickinson
A dog's belated feet,Dickinson
Like intermittent plush were heard,Dickinson
Adown the empty street.,Dickinson
To feel if blinds be fast,Dickinson
And closer to the fire,Dickinson
And shiver for the poor,Dickinson
The housewife's gentle task.,Dickinson
How pleasanter said she,Dickinson
Unto the sofa opposite,Dickinson
The sleet than May  no thee!,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
POSSESSION.,Dickinson
Did the harebell loose her girdle,Dickinson
To the lover bee,Dickinson
Would the bee the harebell hallow,Dickinson
Much as formerly?,Dickinson
Did the paradise persuaded,Dickinson
Yield her moat of pearl,Dickinson
Would the Eden be an Eden,Dickinson
Or the earl an earl?,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
A charm invests a face,Dickinson
Imperfectly beheld ,Dickinson
The lady dare not lift her veil,Dickinson
For fear it be dispelled.,Dickinson
But peers beyond her mesh,Dickinson
And wishes and denies ,Dickinson
Lest interview annul a want,Dickinson
That image satisfies.,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
THE LOVERS.,Dickinson
The rose did caper on her cheek,Dickinson
Her bodice rose and fell,Dickinson
Her pretty speech like drunken men,Dickinson
Did stagger pitiful.,Dickinson
Her fingers fumbled at her work ,Dickinson
Her needle would not go;,Dickinson
What ailed so smart a little maid,Dickinson
It puzzled me to know,Dickinson
Till opposite I spied a cheek,Dickinson
That bore another rose;,Dickinson
Just opposite another speech,Dickinson
That like the drunkard goes;,Dickinson
A vest that like the bodice danced,Dickinson
To the immortal tune ,Dickinson
Till those two troubled little clocks,Dickinson
Ticked softly into one.,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
In lands I never saw they say,Dickinson
Immortal Alps look down,Dickinson
Whose bonnets touch the firmament,Dickinson
Whose sandals touch the town ,Dickinson
Meek at whose everlasting feet,Dickinson
A myriad daisies play.,Dickinson
Which sir are you and which am I,Dickinson
Upon an August day?,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
The moon is distant from the sea,Dickinson
And yet with amber hands,Dickinson
She leads him docile as a boy,Dickinson
Along appointed sands.,Dickinson
He never misses a degree;,Dickinson
Obedient to her eye,Dickinson
He comes just so far toward the town,Dickinson
Just so far goes away.,Dickinson
Oh Signor thine the amber hand,Dickinson
And mine the distant sea ,Dickinson
Obedient to the least command,Dickinson
Thine eyes impose on me.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
He put the belt around my life ,Dickinson
I heard the buckle snap,Dickinson
And turned away imperial,Dickinson
My lifetime folding up,Dickinson
Deliberate as a duke would do,Dickinson
Henceforth a dedicated sort,Dickinson
A member of the cloud.,Dickinson
Yet not too far to come at call,Dickinson
And do the little toils,Dickinson
That make the circuit of the rest,Dickinson
And deal occasional smiles,Dickinson
To lives that stoop to notice mine,Dickinson
And kindly ask it in ,Dickinson
Whose invitation knew you not,Dickinson
For whom I must decline?,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
THE LOST JEWEL.,Dickinson
I held a jewel in my fingers,Dickinson
And went to sleep.,Dickinson
The day was warm and winds were prosy;,Dickinson
I said 'T will keep.,Dickinson
I woke and chid my honest fingers ,Dickinson
The gem was gone;,Dickinson
And now an amethyst remembrance,Dickinson
Is all I own.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
What if I say I shall not wait?,Dickinson
What if I burst the fleshly gate,Dickinson
And pass escaped to thee?,Dickinson
What if I file this mortal off,Dickinson
See where it hurt me  that 's enough ,Dickinson
And wade in liberty?,Dickinson
They cannot take us any more ,Dickinson
Dungeons may call and guns implore;,Dickinson
Unmeaning now to me,Dickinson
As laughter was an hour ago,Dickinson
Or laces or a travelling show,Dickinson
Or who died yesterday!,Dickinson
III. NATURE.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
MOTHER NATURE.,Dickinson
Nature the gentlest mother,Dickinson
Impatient of no child,Dickinson
The feeblest or the waywardest ,Dickinson
Her admonition mild,Dickinson
In forest and the hill,Dickinson
By traveller is heard,Dickinson
Restraining rampant squirrel,Dickinson
Or too impetuous bird.,Dickinson
How fair her conversation,Dickinson
A summer afternoon ,Dickinson
Her household her assembly;,Dickinson
And when the sun goes down,Dickinson
Her voice among the aisles,Dickinson
Incites the timid prayer,Dickinson
Of the minutest cricket,Dickinson
The most unworthy flower.,Dickinson
When all the children sleep,Dickinson
She turns as long away,Dickinson
As will suffice to light her lamps;,Dickinson
Then bending from the sky,Dickinson
With infinite affection,Dickinson
And infiniter care,Dickinson
Her golden finger on her lip,Dickinson
Wills silence everywhere.,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
OUT OF THE MORNING.,Dickinson
Will there really be a morning?,Dickinson
Is there such a thing as day?,Dickinson
Could I see it from the mountains,Dickinson
If I were as tall as they?,Dickinson
Has it feathers like a bird?,Dickinson
Is it brought from famous countries,Dickinson
Of which I have never heard?,Dickinson
Oh some scholar! Oh some sailor!,Dickinson
Oh some wise man from the skies!,Dickinson
Please to tell a little pilgrim,Dickinson
Where the place called morning lies!,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
Unto a silent sky,Dickinson
Propounded but a single term,Dickinson
Of cautious melody.,Dickinson
Had subjugated test,Dickinson
And lo! her silver principle,Dickinson
Supplanted all the rest.,Dickinson
Nor implement was seen,Dickinson
And place was where the presence was,Dickinson
Circumference between.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
DAY'S PARLOR.,Dickinson
The day came slow till five o'clock,Dickinson
Then sprang before the hills,Dickinson
Like hindered rubies or the light,Dickinson
A sudden musket spills.,Dickinson
The purple could not keep the east,Dickinson
The sunrise shook from fold,Dickinson
Like breadths of topaz packed a night,Dickinson
The lady just unrolled.,Dickinson
The happy winds their timbrels took;,Dickinson
The birds in docile rows,Dickinson
Arranged themselves around their prince,Dickinson
The orchard sparkled like a Jew ,Dickinson
How mighty 't was to stay,Dickinson
A guest in this stupendous place,Dickinson
The parlor of the day!,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
THE SUN'S WOOING.,Dickinson
The sun just touched the morning;,Dickinson
The morning happy thing,Dickinson
Supposed that he had come to dwell,Dickinson
And life would be all spring.,Dickinson
She felt herself supremer ,Dickinson
A raised ethereal thing;,Dickinson
Henceforth for her what holiday!,Dickinson
Meanwhile her wheeling king,Dickinson
Trailed slow along the orchards,Dickinson
His haughty spangled hems,Dickinson
Leaving a new necessity ,Dickinson
The want of diadems!,Dickinson
The morning fluttered staggered,Dickinson
Felt feebly for her crown ,Dickinson
Her unanointed forehead,Dickinson
Henceforth her only one.,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
THE ROBIN.,Dickinson
The robin is the one,Dickinson
That interrupts the morn,Dickinson
With hurried few express reports,Dickinson
When March is scarcely on.,Dickinson
The robin is the one,Dickinson
That overflows the noon,Dickinson
With her cherubic quantity,Dickinson
An April but begun.,Dickinson
The robin is the one,Dickinson
That speechless from her nest,Dickinson
Submits that home and certainty,Dickinson
And sanctity are best.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
THE BUTTERFLY'S DAY.,Dickinson
From cocoon forth a butterfly,Dickinson
As lady from her door,Dickinson
Emerged  a summer afternoon ,Dickinson
Repairing everywhere,Dickinson
Without design that I could trace,Dickinson
Except to stray abroad,Dickinson
On miscellaneous enterprise,Dickinson
The clovers understood.,Dickinson
Her pretty parasol was seen,Dickinson
Contracting in a field,Dickinson
Where men made hay then struggling hard,Dickinson
With an opposing cloud,Dickinson
Where parties phantom as herself,Dickinson
To Nowhere seemed to go,Dickinson
In purposeless circumference,Dickinson
As 't were a tropic show.,Dickinson
And notwithstanding bee that worked,Dickinson
And flower that zealous blew,Dickinson
This audience of idleness,Dickinson
Disdained them from the sky,Dickinson
Till sundown crept a steady tide,Dickinson
And men that made the hay,Dickinson
And afternoon and butterfly,Dickinson
Extinguished in its sea.,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
THE BLUEBIRD.,Dickinson
Before you thought of spring,Dickinson
Except as a surmise,Dickinson
You see God bless his suddenness,Dickinson
A fellow in the skies,Dickinson
Of independent hues,Dickinson
Inspiriting habiliments,Dickinson
Of indigo and brown.,Dickinson
With specimens of song,Dickinson
As if for you to choose,Dickinson
Discretion in the interval,Dickinson
With gay delays he goes,Dickinson
To some superior tree,Dickinson
Without a single leaf,Dickinson
And shouts for joy to nobody,Dickinson
But his seraphic self!,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
APRIL.,Dickinson
An altered look about the hills;,Dickinson
A Tyrian light the village fills;,Dickinson
A wider sunrise in the dawn;,Dickinson
A deeper twilight on the lawn;,Dickinson
A print of a vermilion foot;,Dickinson
A purple finger on the slope;,Dickinson
A flippant fly upon the pane;,Dickinson
A spider at his trade again;,Dickinson
An added strut in chanticleer;,Dickinson
A flower expected everywhere;,Dickinson
An axe shrill singing in the woods;,Dickinson
All this and more I cannot tell,Dickinson
A furtive look you know as well,Dickinson
And Nicodemus' mystery,Dickinson
Receives its annual reply.,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
THE SLEEPING FLOWERS.,Dickinson
Whose are the little beds I asked,Dickinson
Which in the valleys lie?,Dickinson
Some shook their heads and others smiled,Dickinson
And no one made reply.,Dickinson
Perhaps they did not hear I said;,Dickinson
Anemone and bell,Dickinson
Batschia in the blanket red,Dickinson
The crocus stirs her lids,Dickinson
Rhodora's cheek is crimson ,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
MY ROSE.,Dickinson
Pigmy seraphs gone astray,Dickinson
Velvet people from Vevay,Dickinson
Belles from some lost summer day,Dickinson
Bees' exclusive coterie.,Dickinson
Paris could not lay the fold,Dickinson
Belted down with emerald;,Dickinson
Venice could not show a cheek,Dickinson
Of a tint so lustrous meek.,Dickinson
Never such an ambuscade,Dickinson
As of brier and leaf displayed,Dickinson
For my little damask maid.,Dickinson
I had rather wear her grace,Dickinson
Than an earl's distinguished face;,Dickinson
I had rather dwell like her,Dickinson
Than be Duke of Exeter,Dickinson
Royalty enough for me,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
THE ORIOLE'S SECRET.,Dickinson
To hear an oriole sing,Dickinson
May be a common thing,Dickinson
Or only a divine.,Dickinson
It is not of the bird,Dickinson
Who sings the same unheard,Dickinson
As unto crowd.,Dickinson
The fashion of the ear,Dickinson
Attireth that it hear,Dickinson
In dun or fair.,Dickinson
So whether it be rune,Dickinson
Or whether it be none,Dickinson
Is of within;,Dickinson
The tune is in the tree,Dickinson
The sceptic showeth me;,Dickinson
No sir! In thee!,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
THE ORIOLE.,Dickinson
One of the ones that Midas touched,Dickinson
Who failed to touch us all,Dickinson
Was that confiding prodigal,Dickinson
The blissful oriole.,Dickinson
So drunk he disavows it,Dickinson
With badinage divine;,Dickinson
So dazzling we mistake him,Dickinson
For an alighting mine.,Dickinson
A pleader a dissembler,Dickinson
An epicure a thief ,Dickinson
Betimes an oratorio,Dickinson
An ecstasy in chief;,Dickinson
The Jesuit of orchards,Dickinson
He cheats as he enchants,Dickinson
Of an entire attar,Dickinson
For his decamping wants.,Dickinson
The splendor of a Burmah,Dickinson
The meteor of birds,Dickinson
Departing like a pageant,Dickinson
Of ballads and of bards.,Dickinson
I never thought that Jason sought,Dickinson
For any golden fleece;,Dickinson
But then I am a rural man,Dickinson
With thoughts that make for peace.,Dickinson
But if there were a Jason,Dickinson
Tradition suffer me,Dickinson
Behold his lost emolument,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
IN SHADOW.,Dickinson
I dreaded that first robin so,Dickinson
But he is mastered now,Dickinson
And I 'm accustomed to him grown ,Dickinson
He hurts a little though.,Dickinson
I thought if I could only live,Dickinson
Till that first shout got by,Dickinson
Not all pianos in the woods,Dickinson
Had power to mangle me.,Dickinson
I dared not meet the daffodils,Dickinson
For fear their yellow gown,Dickinson
Would pierce me with a fashion,Dickinson
So foreign to my own.,Dickinson
I wished the grass would hurry,Dickinson
So when 't was time to see,Dickinson
He 'd be too tall the tallest one,Dickinson
Could stretch to look at me.,Dickinson
I could not bear the bees should come,Dickinson
I wished they 'd stay away,Dickinson
In those dim countries where they go,Dickinson
What word had they for me?,Dickinson
They 're here though; not a creature failed,Dickinson
No blossom stayed away,Dickinson
In gentle deference to me,Dickinson
The Queen of Calvary.,Dickinson
Each one salutes me as he goes,Dickinson
And I my childish plumes,Dickinson
Lift in bereaved acknowledgment,Dickinson
Of their unthinking drums.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
A route of evanescence,Dickinson
With a revolving wheel;,Dickinson
A resonance of emerald,Dickinson
A rush of cochineal;,Dickinson
And every blossom on the bush,Dickinson
Adjusts its tumbled head ,Dickinson
The mail from Tunis probably,Dickinson
An easy morning's ride.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
SECRETS.,Dickinson
The skies can't keep their secret!,Dickinson
They tell it to the hills ,Dickinson
The hills just tell the orchards ,Dickinson
And they the daffodils!,Dickinson
A bird by chance that goes that way,Dickinson
Soft overheard the whole.,Dickinson
If I should bribe the little bird,Dickinson
Who knows but she would tell?,Dickinson
I think I won't however,Dickinson
It's finer not to know;,Dickinson
If summer were an axiom,Dickinson
What sorcery had snow?,Dickinson
So keep your secret Father!,Dickinson
I would not if I could,Dickinson
Know what the sapphire fellows do,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
Who robbed the woods,Dickinson
The trusting woods?,Dickinson
The unsuspecting trees,Dickinson
Brought out their burrs and mosses,Dickinson
His fantasy to please.,Dickinson
He scanned their trinkets curious,Dickinson
He grasped he bore away.,Dickinson
What will the solemn hemlock,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
TWO VOYAGERS.,Dickinson
Two butterflies went out at noon,Dickinson
And waltzed above a stream,Dickinson
Then stepped straight through the firmament,Dickinson
And rested on a beam;,Dickinson
And then together bore away,Dickinson
Upon a shining sea ,Dickinson
Though never yet in any port,Dickinson
Their coming mentioned be.,Dickinson
If spoken by the distant bird,Dickinson
If met in ether sea,Dickinson
By frigate or by merchantman,Dickinson
Report was not to me.,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
BY THE SEA.,Dickinson
I started early took my dog,Dickinson
And visited the sea;,Dickinson
The mermaids in the basement,Dickinson
Came out to look at me,Dickinson
And frigates in the upper floor,Dickinson
Extended hempen hands,Dickinson
Presuming me to be a mouse,Dickinson
Aground upon the sands.,Dickinson
But no man moved me till the tide,Dickinson
Went past my simple shoe,Dickinson
And past my apron and my belt,Dickinson
And past my bodice too,Dickinson
And made as he would eat me up,Dickinson
As wholly as a dew,Dickinson
Upon a dandelion's sleeve ,Dickinson
And then I started too.,Dickinson
And he  he followed close behind;,Dickinson
I felt his silver heel,Dickinson
Upon my ankle  then my shoes,Dickinson
Would overflow with pearl.,Dickinson
Until we met the solid town,Dickinson
No man he seemed to know;,Dickinson
And bowing with a mighty look,Dickinson
At me the sea withdrew.,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
Arcturus is his other name ,Dickinson
I'd rather call him star!,Dickinson
It's so unkind of science,Dickinson
To go and interfere!,Dickinson
I pull a flower from the woods ,Dickinson
A monster with a glass,Dickinson
Computes the stamens in a breath,Dickinson
And has her in a class.,Dickinson
Whereas I took the butterfly,Dickinson
Aforetime in my hat,Dickinson
He sits erect in cabinets,Dickinson
What once was heaven is zenith now.,Dickinson
Where I proposed to go,Dickinson
When time's brief masquerade was done,Dickinson
Is mapped and charted too!,Dickinson
What if the poles should frisk about,Dickinson
And stand upon their heads!,Dickinson
I hope I 'm ready for the worst,Dickinson
Whatever prank betides!,Dickinson
Perhaps the kingdom of Heaven 's changed!,Dickinson
I hope the children there,Dickinson
And laugh at me and stare!,Dickinson
I hope the father in the skies,Dickinson
Will lift his little girl ,Dickinson
Over the stile of pearl!,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
A TEMPEST.,Dickinson
An awful tempest mashed the air,Dickinson
The clouds were gaunt and few;,Dickinson
A black as of a spectre's cloak,Dickinson
Hid heaven and earth from view.,Dickinson
The creatures chuckled on the roofs,Dickinson
And whistled in the air,Dickinson
And shook their fists and gnashed their teeth.,Dickinson
And swung their frenzied hair.,Dickinson
The morning lit the birds arose;,Dickinson
The monster's faded eyes,Dickinson
Turned slowly to his native coast,Dickinson
And peace was Paradise!,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
THE SEA.,Dickinson
An everywhere of silver,Dickinson
With ropes of sand,Dickinson
To keep it from effacing,Dickinson
The track called land.,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
IN THE GARDEN.,Dickinson
A bird came down the walk,Dickinson
He did not know I saw;,Dickinson
And ate the fellow raw.,Dickinson
And then he drank a dew,Dickinson
From a convenient grass,Dickinson
And then hopped sidewise to the wall,Dickinson
To let a beetle pass.,Dickinson
He glanced with rapid eyes,Dickinson
That hurried all abroad ,Dickinson
They looked like frightened beads I thought;,Dickinson
He stirred his velvet head,Dickinson
Like one in danger; cautious,Dickinson
I offered him a crumb,Dickinson
And he unrolled his feathers,Dickinson
And rowed him softer home,Dickinson
Than oars divide the ocean,Dickinson
Too silver for a seam,Dickinson
Or butterflies off banks of noon,Dickinson
Leap plashless as they swim.,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
THE SNAKE.,Dickinson
A narrow fellow in the grass,Dickinson
Occasionally rides;,Dickinson
You may have met him  did you not,Dickinson
His notice sudden is.,Dickinson
The grass divides as with a comb,Dickinson
A spotted shaft is seen;,Dickinson
And then it closes at your feet,Dickinson
And opens further on.,Dickinson
He likes a boggy acre,Dickinson
A floor too cool for corn.,Dickinson
Yet when a child and barefoot,Dickinson
I more than once at morn,Dickinson
Unbraiding in the sun ,Dickinson
When stooping to secure it,Dickinson
It wrinkled and was gone.,Dickinson
Several of nature's people,Dickinson
I know and they know me;,Dickinson
I feel for them a transport,Dickinson
Of cordiality;,Dickinson
But never met this fellow,Dickinson
Attended or alone,Dickinson
Without a tighter breathing,Dickinson
And zero at the bone.,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
THE MUSHROOM.,Dickinson
The mushroom is the elf of plants,Dickinson
At evening it is not;,Dickinson
At morning in a truffled hut,Dickinson
It stops upon a spot,Dickinson
As if it tarried always;,Dickinson
And yet its whole career,Dickinson
Is shorter than a snake's delay,Dickinson
And fleeter than a tare.,Dickinson
T is vegetation's juggler,Dickinson
The germ of alibi;,Dickinson
Doth like a bubble antedate,Dickinson
And like a bubble hie.,Dickinson
I feel as if the grass were pleased,Dickinson
To have it intermit;,Dickinson
The surreptitious scion,Dickinson
Of summer's circumspect.,Dickinson
Had nature any outcast face,Dickinson
Could she a son contemn,Dickinson
Had nature an Iscariot,Dickinson
That mushroom  it is him.,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
THE STORM.,Dickinson
There came a wind like a bugle;,Dickinson
It quivered through the grass,Dickinson
And a green chill upon the heat,Dickinson
So ominous did pass,Dickinson
We barred the windows and the doors,Dickinson
As from an emerald ghost;,Dickinson
The doom's electric moccason,Dickinson
That very instant passed.,Dickinson
On a strange mob of panting trees,Dickinson
And fences fled away,Dickinson
And rivers where the houses ran,Dickinson
The living looked that day.,Dickinson
The bell within the steeple wild,Dickinson
The flying tidings whirled.,Dickinson
How much can come,Dickinson
And much can go,Dickinson
And yet abide the world!,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
THE SPIDER.,Dickinson
A spider sewed at night,Dickinson
Without a light,Dickinson
Upon an arc of white.,Dickinson
If ruff it was of dame,Dickinson
Or shroud of gnome,Dickinson
Himself himself inform.,Dickinson
Of immortality,Dickinson
His strategy,Dickinson
Was physiognomy.,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
I know a place where summer strives,Dickinson
With such a practised frost,Dickinson
She each year leads her daisies back,Dickinson
Recording briefly Lost.,Dickinson
But when the south wind stirs the pools,Dickinson
And struggles in the lanes,Dickinson
Her heart misgives her for her vow,Dickinson
And she pours soft refrains,Dickinson
Into the lap of adamant,Dickinson
And spices and the dew,Dickinson
That stiffens quietly to quartz,Dickinson
Upon her amber shoe.,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
The one that could repeat the summer day,Dickinson
Were greater than itself though he,Dickinson
Minutest of mankind might be.,Dickinson
And who could reproduce the sun,Dickinson
At period of going down ,Dickinson
The lingering and the stain I mean ,Dickinson
When Orient has been outgrown,Dickinson
And Occident becomes unknown,Dickinson
His name remain.,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
THE WlND'S VISIT.,Dickinson
The wind tapped like a tired man,Dickinson
And like a host Come in,Dickinson
I boldly answered; entered then,Dickinson
My residence within,Dickinson
A rapid footless guest,Dickinson
To offer whom a chair,Dickinson
Were as impossible as hand,Dickinson
A sofa to the air.,Dickinson
No bone had he to bind him,Dickinson
His speech was like the push,Dickinson
From a superior bush.,Dickinson
His countenance a billow,Dickinson
His fingers if he pass,Dickinson
Let go a music as of tunes,Dickinson
Blown tremulous in glass.,Dickinson
He visited still flitting;,Dickinson
Then like a timid man,Dickinson
Again he tapped  't was flurriedly ,Dickinson
And I became alone.,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
Nature rarer uses yellow,Dickinson
Than another hue;,Dickinson
Saves she all of that for sunsets ,Dickinson
Prodigal of blue,Dickinson
Spending scarlet like a woman,Dickinson
Yellow she affords,Dickinson
Only scantly and selectly,Dickinson
Like a lover's words.,Dickinson
XXXII.,Dickinson
GOSSIP.,Dickinson
The leaves like women interchange,Dickinson
Sagacious confidence;,Dickinson
Somewhat of nods and somewhat of,Dickinson
Portentous inference,Dickinson
The parties in both cases,Dickinson
Enjoining secrecy ,Dickinson
Inviolable compact,Dickinson
To notoriety.,Dickinson
XXXIII.,Dickinson
SIMPLICITY.,Dickinson
How happy is the little stone,Dickinson
That rambles in the road alone,Dickinson
And doesn't care about careers,Dickinson
And exigencies never fears;,Dickinson
Whose coat of elemental brown,Dickinson
And independent as the sun,Dickinson
Associates or glows alone,Dickinson
Fulfilling absolute decree,Dickinson
In casual simplicity.,Dickinson
XXXIV.,Dickinson
STORM.,Dickinson
It sounded as if the streets were running,Dickinson
And then the streets stood still.,Dickinson
Eclipse was all we could see at the window,Dickinson
And awe was all we could feel.,Dickinson
By and by the boldest stole out of his covert,Dickinson
To see if time was there.,Dickinson
Nature was in her beryl apron,Dickinson
Mixing fresher air.,Dickinson
XXXV.,Dickinson
THE RAT.,Dickinson
The rat is the concisest tenant.,Dickinson
He pays no rent ,Dickinson
Repudiates the obligation,Dickinson
On schemes intent.,Dickinson
Balking our wit,Dickinson
To sound or circumvent,Dickinson
Hate cannot harm,Dickinson
A foe so reticent.,Dickinson
Neither decree,Dickinson
Prohibits him,Dickinson
Lawful as,Dickinson
Equilibrium.,Dickinson
XXXVI.,Dickinson
Frequently the woods are pink,Dickinson
Frequently are brown;,Dickinson
Frequently the hills undress,Dickinson
Behind my native town.,Dickinson
Oft a head is crested,Dickinson
I was wont to see,Dickinson
And as oft a cranny,Dickinson
Where it used to be.,Dickinson
And the earth they tell me,Dickinson
On its axis turned ,Dickinson
Wonderful rotation,Dickinson
By but twelve performed!,Dickinson
XXXVII.,Dickinson
The wind begun to rock the grass,Dickinson
With threatening tunes and low ,Dickinson
He flung a menace at the earth,Dickinson
A menace at the sky.,Dickinson
The leaves unhooked themselves from trees,Dickinson
And started all abroad;,Dickinson
The dust did scoop itself like hands,Dickinson
And throw away the road.,Dickinson
The wagons quickened on the streets,Dickinson
The thunder hurried slow;,Dickinson
The lightning showed a yellow beak,Dickinson
And then a livid claw.,Dickinson
The birds put up the bars to nests,Dickinson
The cattle fled to barns;,Dickinson
There came one drop of giant rain,Dickinson
And then as if the hands,Dickinson
That held the dams had parted hold,Dickinson
The waters wrecked the sky,Dickinson
But overlooked my father's house,Dickinson
Just quartering a tree.,Dickinson
XXXVIII.,Dickinson
WITH FLOWERS.,Dickinson
South winds jostle them,Dickinson
Bumblebees come,Dickinson
Hover hesitate,Dickinson
Drink and are gone.,Dickinson
Butterflies pause,Dickinson
On their passage Cashmere;,Dickinson
I softly plucking,Dickinson
Present them here!,Dickinson
XXXIX.,Dickinson
SUNSET.,Dickinson
Where ships of purple gently toss,Dickinson
On seas of daffodil,Dickinson
Fantastic sailors mingle,Dickinson
And then  the wharf is still.,Dickinson
XL.,Dickinson
And leaves the shreds behind;,Dickinson
Oh housewife in the evening west,Dickinson
Come back and dust the pond!,Dickinson
You dropped a purple ravelling in,Dickinson
You dropped an amber thread;,Dickinson
And now you 've littered all the East,Dickinson
With duds of emerald!,Dickinson
And still she plies her spotted brooms,Dickinson
And still the aprons fly,Dickinson
Till brooms fade softly into stars ,Dickinson
And then I come away.,Dickinson
XLI.,Dickinson
Like mighty footlights burned the red,Dickinson
At bases of the trees ,Dickinson
The far theatricals of day,Dickinson
Exhibiting to these.,Dickinson
While chiefest of the crowd,Dickinson
Enabled by his royal dress,Dickinson
Myself distinguished God.,Dickinson
XLII.,Dickinson
PROBLEMS.,Dickinson
Bring me the sunset in a cup,Dickinson
Reckon the morning's flagons up,Dickinson
And say how many dew;,Dickinson
Tell me how far the morning leaps,Dickinson
Tell me what time the weaver sleeps,Dickinson
Who spun the breadths of blue!,Dickinson
Write me how many notes there be,Dickinson
In the new robin's ecstasy,Dickinson
Among astonished boughs;,Dickinson
How many trips the tortoise makes,Dickinson
How many cups the bee partakes ,Dickinson
The debauchee of dews!,Dickinson
Also who laid the rainbow's piers,Dickinson
Also who leads the docile spheres,Dickinson
By withes of supple blue?,Dickinson
Whose fingers string the stalactite,Dickinson
Who counts the wampum of the night,Dickinson
To see that none is due?,Dickinson
Who built this little Alban house,Dickinson
And shut the windows down so close,Dickinson
My spirit cannot see?,Dickinson
Who 'll let me out some gala day,Dickinson
With implements to fly away,Dickinson
Passing pomposity?,Dickinson
XLIII.,Dickinson
THE JUGGLER OF DAY.,Dickinson
Blazing in gold and quenching in purple,Dickinson
Leaping like leopards to the sky,Dickinson
Then at the feet of the old horizon,Dickinson
Laying her spotted face to die;,Dickinson
Stooping as low as the otter's window,Dickinson
Touching the roof and tinting the barn,Dickinson
Kissing her bonnet to the meadow ,Dickinson
And the juggler of day is gone!,Dickinson
XLIV.,Dickinson
MY CRICKET.,Dickinson
Farther in summer than the birds,Dickinson
Pathetic from the grass,Dickinson
A minor nation celebrates,Dickinson
Its unobtrusive mass.,Dickinson
No ordinance is seen,Dickinson
So gradual the grace,Dickinson
A pensive custom it becomes,Dickinson
Enlarging loneliness.,Dickinson
Antiquest felt at noon,Dickinson
When August burning low,Dickinson
Calls forth this spectral canticle,Dickinson
Repose to typify.,Dickinson
Remit as yet no grace,Dickinson
No furrow on the glow,Dickinson
Yet a druidic difference,Dickinson
Enhances nature now.,Dickinson
XLV.,Dickinson
As imperceptibly as grief,Dickinson
The summer lapsed away ,Dickinson
Too imperceptible at last,Dickinson
To seem like perfidy.,Dickinson
A quietness distilled,Dickinson
As twilight long begun,Dickinson
Or Nature spending with herself,Dickinson
Sequestered afternoon.,Dickinson
The dusk drew earlier in,Dickinson
The morning foreign shone ,Dickinson
A courteous yet harrowing grace,Dickinson
As guest who would be gone.,Dickinson
And thus without a wing,Dickinson
Or service of a keel,Dickinson
Our summer made her light escape,Dickinson
Into the beautiful.,Dickinson
XLVI.,Dickinson
It can't be summer  that got through;,Dickinson
It 's early yet for spring;,Dickinson
There 's that long town of white to cross,Dickinson
Before the blackbirds sing.,Dickinson
It can't be dying  it's too rouge ,Dickinson
The dead shall go in white.,Dickinson
So sunset shuts my question down,Dickinson
With clasps of chrysolite.,Dickinson
XLVII.,Dickinson
SUMMER'S OBSEQUIES.,Dickinson
The gentian weaves her fringes,Dickinson
The maple's loom is red.,Dickinson
My departing blossoms,Dickinson
Obviate parade.,Dickinson
A brief but patient illness,Dickinson
An hour to prepare;,Dickinson
And one below this morning,Dickinson
Is where the angels are.,Dickinson
It was a short procession ,Dickinson
The bobolink was there,Dickinson
An aged bee addressed us,Dickinson
And then we knelt in prayer.,Dickinson
We trust that she was willing ,Dickinson
We ask that we may be.,Dickinson
Summer sister seraph,Dickinson
Let us go with thee!,Dickinson
In the name of the bee,Dickinson
And of the butterfly,Dickinson
And of the breeze amen!,Dickinson
XLVIII.,Dickinson
FRINGED GENTIAN.,Dickinson
God made a little gentian;,Dickinson
It tried to be a rose,Dickinson
And failed and all the summer laughed.,Dickinson
But just before the snows,Dickinson
There came a purple creature,Dickinson
That ravished all the hill;,Dickinson
And summer hid her forehead,Dickinson
And mockery was still.,Dickinson
The frosts were her condition;,Dickinson
The Tyrian would not come,Dickinson
Until the North evoked it.,Dickinson
Creator! shall I bloom?,Dickinson
XLIX.,Dickinson
NOVEMBER.,Dickinson
Besides the autumn poets sing,Dickinson
A few prosaic days,Dickinson
A little this side of the snow,Dickinson
And that side of the haze.,Dickinson
A few incisive mornings,Dickinson
A few ascetic eyes ,Dickinson
And Mr. Thomson's sheaves.,Dickinson
Still is the bustle in the brook,Dickinson
Sealed are the spicy valves;,Dickinson
Mesmeric fingers softly touch,Dickinson
The eyes of many elves.,Dickinson
Perhaps a squirrel may remain,Dickinson
My sentiments to share.,Dickinson
Grant me O Lord a sunny mind,Dickinson
Thy windy will to bear!,Dickinson
L.,Dickinson
THE SNOW.,Dickinson
It sifts from leaden sieves,Dickinson
It powders all the wood,Dickinson
It fills with alabaster wool,Dickinson
The wrinkles of the road.,Dickinson
It makes an even face,Dickinson
Of mountain and of plain ,Dickinson
Unbroken forehead from the east,Dickinson
Unto the east again.,Dickinson
It reaches to the fence,Dickinson
It wraps it rail by rail,Dickinson
Till it is lost in fleeces;,Dickinson
It flings a crystal veil,Dickinson
On stump and stack and stem ,Dickinson
The summer's empty room,Dickinson
Acres of seams where harvests were,Dickinson
Recordless but for them.,Dickinson
It ruffles wrists of posts,Dickinson
As ankles of a queen ,Dickinson
Then stills its artisans like ghosts,Dickinson
Denying they have been.,Dickinson
LI.,Dickinson
THE BLUE JAY.,Dickinson
No brigadier throughout the year,Dickinson
So civic as the jay.,Dickinson
A neighbor and a warrior too,Dickinson
With shrill felicity,Dickinson
Pursuing winds that censure us,Dickinson
A February day,Dickinson
Was never blown away.,Dickinson
The snow and he are intimate;,Dickinson
I 've often seen them play,Dickinson
When heaven looked upon us all,Dickinson
With such severity,Dickinson
I felt apology were due,Dickinson
To an insulted sky,Dickinson
Whose pompous frown was nutriment,Dickinson
To their temerity.,Dickinson
The pillow of this daring head,Dickinson
Is pungent evergreens;,Dickinson
His larder  terse and militant ,Dickinson
Unknown refreshing things;,Dickinson
His character a tonic,Dickinson
His future a dispute;,Dickinson
Unfair an immortality,Dickinson
That leaves this neighbor out.,Dickinson
IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
Let down the bars O Death!,Dickinson
The tired flocks come in,Dickinson
Whose bleating ceases to repeat,Dickinson
Whose wandering is done.,Dickinson
Thine is the stillest night,Dickinson
Thine the securest fold;,Dickinson
Too near thou art for seeking thee,Dickinson
Too tender to be told.,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
Going to heaven!,Dickinson
I don't know when,Dickinson
Pray do not ask me how ,Dickinson
Indeed I 'm too astonished,Dickinson
To think of answering you!,Dickinson
Going to heaven! ,Dickinson
How dim it sounds!,Dickinson
And yet it will be done,Dickinson
As sure as flocks go home at night,Dickinson
Unto the shepherd's arm!,Dickinson
Perhaps you 're going too!,Dickinson
Who knows?,Dickinson
If you should get there first,Dickinson
Save just a little place for me,Dickinson
Close to the two I lost!,Dickinson
The smallest robe will fit me,Dickinson
And just a bit of crown;,Dickinson
For you know we do not mind our dress,Dickinson
When we are going home.,Dickinson
I 'm glad I don't believe it,Dickinson
For it would stop my breath,Dickinson
And I 'd like to look a little more,Dickinson
At such a curious earth!,Dickinson
I am glad they did believe it,Dickinson
Whom I have never found,Dickinson
Since the mighty autumn afternoon,Dickinson
I left them in the ground.,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
At least to pray is left is left.,Dickinson
O Jesus! in the air,Dickinson
I know not which thy chamber is ,Dickinson
I 'm knocking everywhere.,Dickinson
Thou stirrest earthquake in the South,Dickinson
And maelstrom in the sea;,Dickinson
Say Jesus Christ of Nazareth,Dickinson
Hast thou no arm for me?,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
EPITAPH.,Dickinson
Step lightly on this narrow spot!,Dickinson
The broadest land that grows,Dickinson
Is not so ample as the breast,Dickinson
These emerald seams enclose.,Dickinson
Step lofty; for this name is told,Dickinson
As far as cannon dwell,Dickinson
Or flag subsist or fame export,Dickinson
Her deathless syllable.,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
Morns like these we parted;,Dickinson
Noons like these she rose,Dickinson
Fluttering first then firmer,Dickinson
To her fair repose.,Dickinson
Never did she lisp it,Dickinson
And 't was not for me;,Dickinson
She was mute from transport,Dickinson
I from agony!,Dickinson
Till the evening nearing,Dickinson
One the shutters drew ,Dickinson
Quick! a sharper rustling!,Dickinson
And this linnet flew!,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
Who till they died did not alive become;,Dickinson
Who had they lived had died but when,Dickinson
They died vitality begun.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
I read my sentence steadily,Dickinson
Reviewed it with my eyes,Dickinson
To see that I made no mistake,Dickinson
In its extremest clause ,Dickinson
The date and manner of the shame;,Dickinson
And then the pious form,Dickinson
That God have mercy on the soul,Dickinson
The jury voted him.,Dickinson
I made my soul familiar,Dickinson
With her extremity,Dickinson
That at the last it should not be,Dickinson
A novel agony,Dickinson
But she and Death acquainted,Dickinson
Meet tranquilly as friends,Dickinson
Salute and pass without a hint ,Dickinson
And there the matter ends.,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
I have not told my garden yet,Dickinson
Lest that should conquer me;,Dickinson
I have not quite the strength now,Dickinson
To break it to the bee.,Dickinson
I will not name it in the street,Dickinson
For shops would stare that I,Dickinson
So shy so very ignorant,Dickinson
Should have the face to die.,Dickinson
The hillsides must not know it,Dickinson
Where I have rambled so,Dickinson
Nor tell the loving forests,Dickinson
The day that I shall go,Dickinson
Nor lisp it at the table,Dickinson
Nor heedless by the way,Dickinson
Hint that within the riddle,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
They dropped like flakes they dropped like stars,Dickinson
Like petals from a rose,Dickinson
When suddenly across the June,Dickinson
A wind with fingers goes.,Dickinson
They perished in the seamless grass ,Dickinson
No eye could find the place;,Dickinson
But God on his repealless list,Dickinson
Can summon every face.,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
The only ghost I ever saw,Dickinson
Was dressed in mechlin  so;,Dickinson
He wore no sandal on his foot,Dickinson
And stepped like flakes of snow.,Dickinson
His gait was soundless like the bird,Dickinson
But rapid like the roe;,Dickinson
His fashions quaint mosaic,Dickinson
Or haply mistletoe.,Dickinson
His conversation seldom,Dickinson
His laughter like the breeze,Dickinson
That dies away in dimples,Dickinson
Among the pensive trees.,Dickinson
Our interview was transient,Dickinson
Of me himself was shy;,Dickinson
And God forbid I look behind,Dickinson
Since that appalling day!,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
Some too fragile for winter winds,Dickinson
The thoughtful grave encloses ,Dickinson
Tenderly tucking them in from frost,Dickinson
Before their feet are cold.,Dickinson
Never the treasures in her nest,Dickinson
The cautious grave exposes,Dickinson
Building where schoolboy dare not look,Dickinson
And sportsman is not bold.,Dickinson
This covert have all the children,Dickinson
Early aged and often cold ,Dickinson
Sparrows unnoticed by the Father;,Dickinson
Lambs for whom time had not a fold.,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
As by the dead we love to sit,Dickinson
Become so wondrous dear,Dickinson
As for the lost we grapple,Dickinson
Though all the rest are here ,Dickinson
In broken mathematics,Dickinson
We estimate our prize,Dickinson
Vast in its fading ratio,Dickinson
To our penurious eyes!,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
MEMORIALS.,Dickinson
Death sets a thing significant,Dickinson
The eye had hurried by,Dickinson
Except a perished creature,Dickinson
Entreat us tenderly,Dickinson
To ponder little workmanships,Dickinson
In crayon or in wool,Dickinson
With This was last her fingers did,Dickinson
Industrious until,Dickinson
The thimble weighed too heavy,Dickinson
The stitches stopped themselves,Dickinson
And then 't was put among the dust,Dickinson
Upon the closet shelves.,Dickinson
A book I have a friend gave,Dickinson
Whose pencil here and there,Dickinson
Had notched the place that pleased him ,Dickinson
At rest his fingers are.,Dickinson
Now when I read I read not,Dickinson
For interrupting tears,Dickinson
Obliterate the etchings,Dickinson
Too costly for repairs.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
I went to heaven ,Dickinson
T was a small town,Dickinson
Lit with a ruby,Dickinson
Lathed with down.,Dickinson
Stiller than the fields,Dickinson
At the full dew,Dickinson
Beautiful as pictures,Dickinson
No man drew.,Dickinson
People like the moth,Dickinson
Of mechlin frames,Dickinson
Duties of gossamer,Dickinson
And eider names.,Dickinson
Almost contented,Dickinson
I could be,Dickinson
'Mong such unique,Dickinson
Society.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
Their height in heaven comforts not,Dickinson
Their glory nought to me;,Dickinson
T was best imperfect as it was;,Dickinson
I 'm finite I can't see.,Dickinson
The house of supposition,Dickinson
The glimmering frontier,Dickinson
That skirts the acres of perhaps,Dickinson
To me shows insecure.,Dickinson
The wealth I had contented me;,Dickinson
If 't was a meaner size,Dickinson
Then I had counted it until,Dickinson
It pleased my narrow eyes,Dickinson
Better than larger values,Dickinson
However true their show;,Dickinson
This timid life of evidence,Dickinson
Keeps pleading I don't know.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
There is a shame of nobleness,Dickinson
Confronting sudden pelf ,Dickinson
A finer shame of ecstasy,Dickinson
Convicted of itself.,Dickinson
A best disgrace a brave man feels,Dickinson
Acknowledged of the brave ,Dickinson
One more Ye Blessed to be told;,Dickinson
But this involves the grave.,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
TRIUMPH.,Dickinson
Triumph may be of several kinds.,Dickinson
There 's triumph in the room,Dickinson
When that old imperator Death,Dickinson
By faith is overcome.,Dickinson
There 's triumph of the finer mind,Dickinson
When truth affronted long,Dickinson
Advances calm to her supreme,Dickinson
Her God her only throng.,Dickinson
A triumph when temptation's bribe,Dickinson
Is slowly handed back,Dickinson
One eye upon the heaven renounced,Dickinson
And one upon the rack.,Dickinson
Severer triumph by himself,Dickinson
Experienced who can pass,Dickinson
Acquitted from that naked bar,Dickinson
Jehovah's countenance!,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
Pompless no life can pass away;,Dickinson
The lowliest career,Dickinson
To the same pageant wends its way,Dickinson
As that exalted here.,Dickinson
How cordial is the mystery!,Dickinson
The hospitable pall,Dickinson
A this way beckons spaciously ,Dickinson
A miracle for all!,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
I noticed people disappeared,Dickinson
When but a little child ,Dickinson
Supposed they visited remote,Dickinson
Or settled regions wild.,Dickinson
Now know I they both visited,Dickinson
And settled regions wild,Dickinson
But did because they died  a fact,Dickinson
Withheld the little child!,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
FOLLOWING.,Dickinson
I had no cause to be awake,Dickinson
My best was gone to sleep,Dickinson
And morn a new politeness took,Dickinson
And failed to wake them up,Dickinson
But called the others clear,Dickinson
And passed their curtains by.,Dickinson
Knock recollect for me!,Dickinson
I looked at sunrise once,Dickinson
And then I looked at them,Dickinson
And wishfulness in me arose,Dickinson
For circumstance the same.,Dickinson
T was such an ample peace,Dickinson
It could not hold a sigh ,Dickinson
T was Sabbath with the bells divorced,Dickinson
'T was sunset all the day.,Dickinson
So choosing but a gown,Dickinson
And taking but a prayer,Dickinson
The only raiment I should need,Dickinson
I struggled and was there.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
If anybody's friend be dead,Dickinson
It 's sharpest of the theme,Dickinson
The thinking how they walked alive,Dickinson
At such and such a time.,Dickinson
Their costume of a Sunday,Dickinson
Some manner of the hair ,Dickinson
A prank nobody knew but them,Dickinson
Lost in the sepulchre.,Dickinson
How warm they were on such a day,Dickinson
You almost feel the date,Dickinson
So short way off it seems; and now,Dickinson
They 're centuries from that.,Dickinson
How pleased they were at what you said;,Dickinson
You try to touch the smile,Dickinson
And dip your fingers in the frost,Dickinson
When was it can you tell,Dickinson
You asked the company to tea,Dickinson
Acquaintance just a few,Dickinson
And chatted close with this grand thing,Dickinson
That don't remember you?,Dickinson
Past bows and invitations,Dickinson
Past interview and vow,Dickinson
Past what ourselves can estimate ,Dickinson
That makes the quick of woe!,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
THE JOURNEY.,Dickinson
Our journey had advanced;,Dickinson
Our feet were almost come,Dickinson
To that odd fork in Being's road,Dickinson
Eternity by term.,Dickinson
Our pace took sudden awe,Dickinson
Our feet reluctant led.,Dickinson
Before were cities but between,Dickinson
The forest of the dead.,Dickinson
Retreat was out of hope ,Dickinson
Behind a sealed route,Dickinson
Eternity's white flag before,Dickinson
And God at every gate.,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
A COUNTRY BURIAL.,Dickinson
Ample make this bed.,Dickinson
Make this bed with awe;,Dickinson
In it wait till judgment break,Dickinson
Excellent and fair.,Dickinson
Be its mattress straight,Dickinson
Be its pillow round;,Dickinson
Let no sunrise' yellow noise,Dickinson
Interrupt this ground.,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
GOING.,Dickinson
On such a night or such a night,Dickinson
Would anybody care,Dickinson
If such a little figure,Dickinson
Slipped quiet from its chair,Dickinson
So quiet oh how quiet!,Dickinson
That nobody might know,Dickinson
But that the little figure,Dickinson
Rocked softer to and fro?,Dickinson
On such a dawn or such a dawn,Dickinson
Would anybody sigh,Dickinson
That such a little figure,Dickinson
Too sound asleep did lie,Dickinson
For chanticleer to wake it ,Dickinson
Or stirring house below,Dickinson
Or giddy bird in orchard,Dickinson
Or early task to do?,Dickinson
There was a little figure plump,Dickinson
For every little knoll,Dickinson
Busy needles and spools of thread,Dickinson
And trudging feet from school.,Dickinson
Playmates and holidays and nuts,Dickinson
And visions vast and small.,Dickinson
Strange that the feet so precious charged,Dickinson
Should reach so small a goal!,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
Essential oils are wrung,Dickinson
The attar from the rose,Dickinson
Is not expressed by suns alone,Dickinson
It is the gift of screws.,Dickinson
The general rose decays;,Dickinson
But this in lady's drawer,Dickinson
Makes summer when the lady lies,Dickinson
In ceaseless rosemary.,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
I lived on dread; to those who know,Dickinson
The stimulus there is,Dickinson
In danger other impetus,Dickinson
As 't were a spur upon the soul,Dickinson
A fear will urge it where,Dickinson
To go without the spectre's aid,Dickinson
Were challenging despair.,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
If I should die,Dickinson
And you should live,Dickinson
And time should gurgle on,Dickinson
And morn should beam,Dickinson
And noon should burn,Dickinson
As it has usual done;,Dickinson
If birds should build as early,Dickinson
And bees as bustling go ,Dickinson
One might depart at option,Dickinson
From enterprise below!,Dickinson
'T is sweet to know that stocks will stand,Dickinson
When we with daisies lie,Dickinson
That commerce will continue,Dickinson
And trades as briskly fly.,Dickinson
It makes the parting tranquil,Dickinson
And keeps the soul serene,Dickinson
That gentlemen so sprightly,Dickinson
Conduct the pleasing scene!,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
AT LENGTH.,Dickinson
Her final summer was it,Dickinson
And yet we guessed it not;,Dickinson
If tenderer industriousness,Dickinson
Pervaded her we thought,Dickinson
A further force of life,Dickinson
Developed from within ,Dickinson
When Death lit all the shortness up,Dickinson
And made the hurry plain.,Dickinson
We wondered at our blindness ,Dickinson
When nothing was to see,Dickinson
At our stupidity,Dickinson
When duller than our dulness,Dickinson
The busy darling lay,Dickinson
So busy was she finishing,Dickinson
So leisurely were we!,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
GHOSTS.,Dickinson
One need not be a chamber to be haunted,Dickinson
One need not be a house;,Dickinson
The brain has corridors surpassing,Dickinson
Material place.,Dickinson
Far safer of a midnight meeting,Dickinson
External ghost,Dickinson
Than an interior confronting,Dickinson
That whiter host.,Dickinson
Far safer through an Abbey gallop,Dickinson
The stones achase,Dickinson
Than moonless one's own self encounter,Dickinson
In lonesome place.,Dickinson
Ourself behind ourself concealed,Dickinson
Should startle most;,Dickinson
Assassin hid in our apartment,Dickinson
Be horror's least.,Dickinson
The prudent carries a revolver,Dickinson
He bolts the door,Dickinson
O'erlooking a superior spectre,Dickinson
More near.,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
VANISHED.,Dickinson
She died  this was the way she died;,Dickinson
And when her breath was done,Dickinson
Took up her simple wardrobe,Dickinson
And started for the sun.,Dickinson
Her little figure at the gate,Dickinson
The angels must have spied,Dickinson
Since I could never find her,Dickinson
Upon the mortal side.,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
PRECEDENCE.,Dickinson
Wait till the majesty of Death,Dickinson
Invests so mean a brow!,Dickinson
Almost a powdered footman,Dickinson
Might dare to touch it now!,Dickinson
Wait till in everlasting robes,Dickinson
This democrat is dressed,Dickinson
Then prate about preferment,Dickinson
And station and the rest!,Dickinson
Around this quiet courtier,Dickinson
Obsequious angels wait!,Dickinson
Full royal is his retinue,Dickinson
Full purple is his state!,Dickinson
A lord might dare to lift the hat,Dickinson
To such a modest clay,Dickinson
Since that my Lord the Lord of lords,Dickinson
Receives unblushingly!,Dickinson
XXXII.,Dickinson
GONE.,Dickinson
Went up a year this evening!,Dickinson
I recollect it well!,Dickinson
Amid no bells nor bravos,Dickinson
The bystanders will tell!,Dickinson
Cheerful as to the village,Dickinson
Tranquil as to repose,Dickinson
Chastened as to the chapel,Dickinson
This humble tourist rose.,Dickinson
Did not talk of returning,Dickinson
Alluded to no time,Dickinson
When were the gales propitious,Dickinson
We might look for him;,Dickinson
Was grateful for the roses,Dickinson
Talked softly of new species,Dickinson
To pick another day.,Dickinson
Beguiling thus the wonder,Dickinson
The wondrous nearer drew;,Dickinson
Hands bustled at the moorings ,Dickinson
The crowd respectful grew.,Dickinson
Ascended from our vision,Dickinson
To countenances new!,Dickinson
A difference a daisy,Dickinson
Is all the rest I knew!,Dickinson
XXXIII.,Dickinson
REQUIEM.,Dickinson
Taken from men this morning,Dickinson
Met by the gods with banners,Dickinson
Who marshalled her away.,Dickinson
One little maid from playmates,Dickinson
One little mind from school ,Dickinson
There must be guests in Eden;,Dickinson
All the rooms are full.,Dickinson
Far as the east from even,Dickinson
Dim as the border star ,Dickinson
Courtiers quaint in kingdoms,Dickinson
Our departed are.,Dickinson
XXXIV.,Dickinson
What inn is this,Dickinson
Where for the night,Dickinson
Peculiar traveller comes?,Dickinson
Who is the landlord?,Dickinson
Where the maids?,Dickinson
Behold what curious rooms!,Dickinson
No ruddy fires on the hearth,Dickinson
No brimming tankards flow.,Dickinson
Necromancer landlord,Dickinson
Who are these below?,Dickinson
XXXV.,Dickinson
It was not death for I stood up,Dickinson
And all the dead lie down;,Dickinson
It was not night for all the bells,Dickinson
Put out their tongues for noon.,Dickinson
It was not frost for on my flesh,Dickinson
I felt siroccos crawl ,Dickinson
Nor fire for just my marble feet,Dickinson
Could keep a chancel cool.,Dickinson
And yet it tasted like them all;,Dickinson
The figures I have seen,Dickinson
Set orderly for burial,Dickinson
Reminded me of mine,Dickinson
As if my life were shaven,Dickinson
And fitted to a frame,Dickinson
And could not breathe without a key;,Dickinson
And 't was like midnight some,Dickinson
When everything that ticked has stopped,Dickinson
And space stares all around,Dickinson
Or grisly frosts first autumn morns,Dickinson
Repeal the beating ground.,Dickinson
But most like chaos  stopless cool ,Dickinson
Without a chance or spar,Dickinson
Or even a report of land,Dickinson
To justify despair.,Dickinson
XXXVI.,Dickinson
TILL THE END.,Dickinson
I should not dare to leave my friend,Dickinson
Because  because if he should die,Dickinson
While I was gone and I  too late ,Dickinson
Should reach the heart that wanted me;,Dickinson
If I should disappoint the eyes,Dickinson
That hunted hunted so to see,Dickinson
And could not bear to shut until,Dickinson
They noticed me  they noticed me;,Dickinson
If I should stab the patient faith,Dickinson
So sure I 'd come  so sure I 'd come,Dickinson
It listening listening went to sleep,Dickinson
Telling my tardy name ,Dickinson
My heart would wish it broke before,Dickinson
Since breaking then since breaking then,Dickinson
Were useless as next morning's sun,Dickinson
Where midnight frosts had lain!,Dickinson
XXXVII.,Dickinson
VOID.,Dickinson
Great streets of silence led away,Dickinson
To neighborhoods of pause;,Dickinson
Here was no notice no dissent,Dickinson
By clocks 't was morning and for night,Dickinson
The bells at distance called;,Dickinson
But epoch had no basis here,Dickinson
For period exhaled.,Dickinson
XXXVIII.,Dickinson
A throe upon the features,Dickinson
A hurry in the breath,Dickinson
An ecstasy of parting,Dickinson
Denominated Death ,Dickinson
An anguish at the mention,Dickinson
Which when to patience grown,Dickinson
I 've known permission given,Dickinson
To rejoin its own.,Dickinson
XXXIX.,Dickinson
SAVED!,Dickinson
Of tribulation these are they,Dickinson
Denoted by the white;,Dickinson
The spangled gowns a lesser rank,Dickinson
Of victors designate.,Dickinson
All these did conquer; but the ones,Dickinson
Who overcame most times,Dickinson
Wear nothing commoner than snow,Dickinson
No ornament but palms.,Dickinson
Surrender is a sort unknown,Dickinson
On this superior soil;,Dickinson
Defeat an outgrown anguish,Dickinson
Remembered as the mile,Dickinson
Our panting ankle barely gained,Dickinson
When night devoured the road;,Dickinson
But we stood whispering in the house,Dickinson
And all we said was Saved!,Dickinson
XL.,Dickinson
I think just how my shape will rise,Dickinson
When I shall be forgiven,Dickinson
Till hair and eyes and timid head,Dickinson
Are out of sight in heaven.,Dickinson
I think just how my lips will weigh,Dickinson
With shapeless quivering prayer,Dickinson
That you so late consider me,Dickinson
The sparrow of your care.,Dickinson
I mind me that of anguish sent,Dickinson
Some drifts were moved away,Dickinson
Before my simple bosom broke ,Dickinson
And why not this if they?,Dickinson
And so until delirious borne,Dickinson
I con that thing  forgiven ,Dickinson
Till with long fright and longer trust,Dickinson
I drop my heart unshriven!,Dickinson
XLI.,Dickinson
THE FORGOTTEN GRAVE.,Dickinson
After a hundred years,Dickinson
Nobody knows the place ,Dickinson
Agony that enacted there,Dickinson
Motionless as peace.,Dickinson
Weeds triumphant ranged,Dickinson
Strangers strolled and spelled,Dickinson
At the lone orthography,Dickinson
Of the elder dead.,Dickinson
Winds of summer fields,Dickinson
Recollect the way ,Dickinson
Instinct picking up the key,Dickinson
Dropped by memory.,Dickinson
XLII.,Dickinson
Lay this laurel on the one,Dickinson
Too intrinsic for renown.,Dickinson
Laurel! veil your deathless tree ,Dickinson
Him you chasten that is he!,Dickinson

Which in the clover dwell.,Dickinson
I. LIFE.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
REAL RICHES.,Dickinson
'T is little I could care for pearls,Dickinson
Who own the ample sea;,Dickinson
Or brooches when the Emperor,Dickinson
With rubies pelteth me;,Dickinson

Or diamonds when I see,Dickinson
A diadem to fit a dome,Dickinson
Continual crowning me.,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
SUPERIORITY TO FATE.,Dickinson
Superiority to fate,Dickinson
Is difficult to learn.,Dickinson

Until to her surprise,Dickinson
The soul with strict economy,Dickinson
Subsists till Paradise.,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
HOPE.,Dickinson
Hope is a subtle glutton;,Dickinson
He feeds upon the fair;,Dickinson
And yet inspected closely,Dickinson

And whatsoever is consumed,Dickinson
The same amounts remain.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson

Heaven is what I cannot reach!,Dickinson
The apple on the tree,Dickinson
Provided it do hopeless hang,Dickinson

Behind the hill the house behind ,Dickinson
There Paradise is found!,Dickinson

A WORD.,Dickinson
A word is dead,Dickinson
When it is said,Dickinson
Some say.,Dickinson
I say it just,Dickinson
Begins to live,Dickinson
That day.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
To venerate the simple days,Dickinson
Which lead the seasons by,Dickinson
Needs but to remember,Dickinson
That from you or me,Dickinson
They may take the trifle,Dickinson
Termed mortality!,Dickinson
To invest existence with a stately air,Dickinson
Needs but to remember,Dickinson
That the acorn there,Dickinson
Is the egg of forests,Dickinson
For the upper air!,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
LIFE'S TRADES.,Dickinson
It's such a little thing to weep,Dickinson
So short a thing to sigh;,Dickinson
And yet by trades the size of these,Dickinson
We men and women die!,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
Drowning is not so pitiful,Dickinson
As the attempt to rise.,Dickinson
Three times 't is said a sinking man,Dickinson
Comes up to face the skies,Dickinson
And then declines forever,Dickinson
To that abhorred abode,Dickinson
Where hope and he part company ,Dickinson
For he is grasped of God.,Dickinson
The Maker's cordial visage,Dickinson
However good to see,Dickinson
Is shunned we must admit it,Dickinson
Like an adversity.,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
How still the bells in steeples stand,Dickinson
Till swollen with the sky,Dickinson
They leap upon their silver feet,Dickinson
In frantic melody!,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
If the foolish call them 'flowers',Dickinson
Need the wiser tell?,Dickinson
If the savans 'classify' them,Dickinson
It is just as well!,Dickinson
Those who read the Revelations,Dickinson
Must not criticise,Dickinson
Those who read the same edition,Dickinson
With beclouded eyes!,Dickinson
Could we stand with that old Moses,Dickinson
Canaan denied ,Dickinson
Scan like him the stately landscape,Dickinson
On the other side ,Dickinson
Doubtless we should deem superfluous,Dickinson
Many sciences,Dickinson
Not pursued by learn�d angels,Dickinson
In scholastic skies!,Dickinson
Low amid that glad Belles lettres,Dickinson
Grant that we may stand,Dickinson
Stars amid profound Galaxies,Dickinson
At that grand 'Right hand'!,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
A SYLLABLE.,Dickinson
Could mortal lip divine,Dickinson
The undeveloped freight,Dickinson
Of a delivered syllable,Dickinson
'T would crumble with the weight.,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
PARTING.,Dickinson
My life closed twice before its close;,Dickinson
It yet remains to see,Dickinson
If Immortality unveil,Dickinson
A third event to me,Dickinson
So huge so hopeless to conceive,Dickinson
As these that twice befell.,Dickinson
Parting is all we know of heaven,Dickinson
And all we need of hell.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
ASPIRATION.,Dickinson
We never know how high we are,Dickinson
Till we are called to rise;,Dickinson
And then if we are true to plan,Dickinson
Our statures touch the skies.,Dickinson
The heroism we recite,Dickinson
Would be a daily thing,Dickinson
Did not ourselves the cubits warp,Dickinson
For fear to be a king.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
THE INEVITABLE.,Dickinson
While I was fearing it it came,Dickinson
But came with less of fear,Dickinson
Because that fearing it so long,Dickinson
Had almost made it dear.,Dickinson
There is a fitting a dismay,Dickinson
A fitting a despair.,Dickinson
Tis harder knowing it is due,Dickinson
Than knowing it is here.,Dickinson
The trying on the utmost,Dickinson
The morning it is new,Dickinson
Is terribler than wearing it,Dickinson
A whole existence through.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
A BOOK.,Dickinson
There is no frigate like a book,Dickinson
To take us lands away,Dickinson
Nor any coursers like a page,Dickinson
Of prancing poetry.,Dickinson
Without oppress of toll;,Dickinson
How frugal is the chariot,Dickinson
That bears a human soul!,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
Who has not found the heaven below,Dickinson
Will fail of it above.,Dickinson
God's residence is next to mine,Dickinson
His furniture is love.,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
A PORTRAIT.,Dickinson
A face devoid of love or grace,Dickinson
A hateful hard successful face,Dickinson
A face with which a stone,Dickinson
Would feel as thoroughly at ease,Dickinson
As were they old acquaintances ,Dickinson
First time together thrown.,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
I HAD A GUINEA GOLDEN.,Dickinson
I had a guinea golden;,Dickinson
I lost it in the sand,Dickinson
And though the sum was simple,Dickinson
And pounds were in the land,Dickinson
Still had it such a value,Dickinson
Unto my frugal eye,Dickinson
That when I could not find it,Dickinson
I sat me down to sigh.,Dickinson
I had a crimson robin,Dickinson
Who sang full many a day,Dickinson
But when the woods were painted,Dickinson
He too did fly away.,Dickinson
Time brought me other robins ,Dickinson
Their ballads were the same ,Dickinson
Still for my missing troubadour,Dickinson
I kept the 'house at hame.',Dickinson
I had a star in heaven;,Dickinson
One Pleiad was its name,Dickinson
And when I was not heeding,Dickinson
It wandered from the same.,Dickinson
And though the skies are crowded,Dickinson
And all the night ashine,Dickinson
I do not care about it,Dickinson
Since none of them are mine.,Dickinson
My story has a moral,Dickinson
I have a missing friend ,Dickinson
Pleiad its name and robin,Dickinson
And guinea in the sand ,Dickinson
And when this mournful ditty,Dickinson
Accompanied with tear,Dickinson
Shall meet the eye of traitor,Dickinson
In country far from here,Dickinson
Grant that repentance solemn,Dickinson
May seize upon his mind,Dickinson
And he no consolation,Dickinson
Beneath the sun may find.,Dickinson
NOTE.  This poem may have had like many others a,Dickinson
personal origin. It is more than probable that it was,Dickinson
sent to some friend travelling in Europe a dainty,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.,Dickinson
From all the jails the boys and girls,Dickinson
Ecstatically leap ,Dickinson
Beloved only afternoon,Dickinson
That prison doesn't keep.,Dickinson
They storm the earth and stun the air,Dickinson
A mob of solid bliss.,Dickinson
Alas! that frowns could lie in wait,Dickinson
For such a foe as this!,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
Few get enough  enough is one;,Dickinson
To that ethereal throng,Dickinson
Have not each one of us the right,Dickinson
To stealthily belong?,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
Upon the gallows hung a wretch,Dickinson
Too sullied for the hell,Dickinson
To which the law entitled him.,Dickinson
As nature's curtain fell,Dickinson
The one who bore him tottered in,Dickinson
For this was woman's son.,Dickinson
'T was all I had' she stricken gasped;,Dickinson
Oh what a livid boon!,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
THE LOST THOUGHT.,Dickinson
I felt a clearing in my mind,Dickinson
As if my brain had split;,Dickinson
I tried to match it seam by seam,Dickinson
But could not make them fit.,Dickinson
The thought behind I strove to join,Dickinson
Unto the thought before,Dickinson
But sequence ravelled out of reach,Dickinson
Like balls upon a floor.,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
RETICENCE.,Dickinson
The reticent volcano keeps,Dickinson
His never slumbering plan;,Dickinson
Confided are his projects pink,Dickinson
To no precarious man.,Dickinson
If nature will not tell the tale,Dickinson
Jehovah told to her,Dickinson
Can human nature not survive,Dickinson
Without a listener?,Dickinson
Admonished by her buckled lips,Dickinson
Let every babbler be.,Dickinson
The only secret people keep,Dickinson
Is Immortality.,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
WITH FLOWERS.,Dickinson
If recollecting were forgetting,Dickinson
Then I remember not;,Dickinson
And if forgetting recollecting,Dickinson
How near I had forgot!,Dickinson
And if to miss were merry,Dickinson
And if to mourn were gay,Dickinson
How very blithe the fingers,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
The farthest thunder that I heard,Dickinson
Was nearer than the sky,Dickinson
And rumbles still though torrid noons,Dickinson
Have lain their missiles by.,Dickinson
The lightning that preceded it,Dickinson
Struck no one but myself,Dickinson
But I would not exchange the bolt,Dickinson
For all the rest of life.,Dickinson
Indebtedness to oxygen,Dickinson
The chemist may repay,Dickinson
But not the obligation,Dickinson
To electricity.,Dickinson
It founds the homes and decks the days,Dickinson
And every clamor bright,Dickinson
Is but the gleam concomitant,Dickinson
Of that waylaying light.,Dickinson
The thought is quiet as a flake ,Dickinson
A crash without a sound;,Dickinson
How life's reverberation,Dickinson
Its explanation found!,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
On the bleakness of my lot,Dickinson
Bloom I strove to raise.,Dickinson
Late my acre of a rock,Dickinson
Yielded grape and maize.,Dickinson
Soil of flint if steadfast tilled,Dickinson
Will reward the hand;,Dickinson
Seed of palm by Lybian sun,Dickinson
Fructified in sand.,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
CONTRAST.,Dickinson
A door just opened on a street ,Dickinson
I lost was passing by ,Dickinson
An instant's width of warmth disclosed,Dickinson
And wealth and company.,Dickinson
The door as sudden shut and I,Dickinson
I lost was passing by ,Dickinson
Lost doubly but by contrast most,Dickinson
Enlightening misery.,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
FRIENDS.,Dickinson
Are friends delight or pain?,Dickinson
Could bounty but remain,Dickinson
Riches were good.,Dickinson
But if they only stay,Dickinson
Bolder to fly away,Dickinson
Riches are sad.,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
FIRE.,Dickinson
Ashes denote that fire was;,Dickinson
Respect the grayest pile,Dickinson
For the departed creature's sake,Dickinson
That hovered there awhile.,Dickinson
Fire exists the first in light,Dickinson
And then consolidates ,Dickinson
Only the chemist can disclose,Dickinson
Into what carbonates.,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
A MAN.,Dickinson
Fate slew him but he did not drop;,Dickinson
She felled  he did not fall ,Dickinson
Impaled him on her fiercest stakes ,Dickinson
He neutralized them all.,Dickinson
She stung him sapped his firm advance,Dickinson
But when her worst was done,Dickinson
And he unmoved regarded her,Dickinson
Acknowledged him a man.,Dickinson
XXXII.,Dickinson
VENTURES.,Dickinson
Finite to fail but infinite to venture.,Dickinson
For the one ship that struts the shore,Dickinson
Many's the gallant overwhelmed creature,Dickinson
Nodding in navies nevermore.,Dickinson
XXXIII.,Dickinson
GRIEFS.,Dickinson
I measure every grief I meet,Dickinson
With analytic eyes;,Dickinson
I wonder if it weighs like mine,Dickinson
Or has an easier size.,Dickinson
I wonder if they bore it long,Dickinson
Or did it just begin?,Dickinson
I could not tell the date of mine,Dickinson
It feels so old a pain.,Dickinson
I wonder if it hurts to live,Dickinson
And if they have to try,Dickinson
And whether could they choose between,Dickinson
They would not rather die.,Dickinson
I wonder if when years have piled ,Dickinson
Some thousands  on the cause,Dickinson
Of early hurt if such a lapse,Dickinson
Could give them any pause;,Dickinson
Or would they go on aching still,Dickinson
Through centuries above,Dickinson
Enlightened to a larger pain,Dickinson
By contrast with the love.,Dickinson
The grieved are many I am told;,Dickinson
The reason deeper lies ,Dickinson
Death is but one and comes but once,Dickinson
And only nails the eyes.,Dickinson
There's grief of want and grief of cold ,Dickinson
A sort they call 'despair;',Dickinson
There's banishment from native eyes,Dickinson
In sight of native air.,Dickinson
And though I may not guess the kind,Dickinson
Correctly yet to me,Dickinson
A piercing comfort it affords,Dickinson
In passing Calvary,Dickinson
To note the fashions of the cross,Dickinson
Of those that stand alone,Dickinson
Still fascinated to presume,Dickinson
That some are like my own.,Dickinson
XXXIV.,Dickinson
I have a king who does not speak;,Dickinson
So wondering thro' the hours meek,Dickinson
I trudge the day away,Dickinson
Half glad when it is night and sleep,Dickinson
If haply thro' a dream to peep,Dickinson
In parlors shut by day.,Dickinson
And if I do when morning comes,Dickinson
It is as if a hundred drums,Dickinson
Did round my pillow roll,Dickinson
And shouts fill all my childish sky,Dickinson
And bells keep saying 'victory',Dickinson
From steeples in my soul!,Dickinson
And if I don't the little Bird,Dickinson
Within the Orchard is not heard,Dickinson
And I omit to pray,Dickinson
For my will goes the other way,Dickinson
And it were perjury!,Dickinson
XXXV.,Dickinson
DISENCHANTMENT.,Dickinson
It dropped so low in my regard,Dickinson
I heard it hit the ground,Dickinson
And go to pieces on the stones,Dickinson
At bottom of my mind;,Dickinson
Yet blamed the fate that fractured less,Dickinson
Than I reviled myself,Dickinson
For entertaining plated wares,Dickinson
Upon my silver shelf.,Dickinson
XXXVI.,Dickinson
LOST FAITH.,Dickinson
To lose one's faith surpasses,Dickinson
The loss of an estate,Dickinson
Because estates can be,Dickinson
Replenished  faith cannot.,Dickinson
Inherited with life,Dickinson
Belief but once can be;,Dickinson
Annihilate a single clause,Dickinson
And Being's beggary.,Dickinson
XXXVII.,Dickinson
LOST JOY.,Dickinson
I had a daily bliss,Dickinson
I half indifferent viewed,Dickinson
Till sudden I perceived it stir ,Dickinson
It grew as I pursued,Dickinson
Till when around a crag,Dickinson
It wasted from my sight,Dickinson
Enlarged beyond my utmost scope,Dickinson
I learned its sweetness right.,Dickinson
XXXVIII.,Dickinson
I worked for chaff and earning wheat,Dickinson
Was haughty and betrayed.,Dickinson
What right had fields to arbitrate,Dickinson
In matters ratified?,Dickinson
I tasted wheat  and hated chaff,Dickinson
And thanked the ample friend;,Dickinson
Wisdom is more becoming viewed,Dickinson
At distance than at hand.,Dickinson
XXXIX.,Dickinson
Life and Death and Giants,Dickinson
Such as these are still.,Dickinson
Minor apparatus hopper of the mill,Dickinson
Beetle at the candle,Dickinson
Or a fife's small fame,Dickinson
Maintain by accident,Dickinson
That they proclaim.,Dickinson
XL.,Dickinson
ALPINE GLOW.,Dickinson
Our lives are Swiss ,Dickinson
So still so cool,Dickinson
Till some odd afternoon,Dickinson
The Alps neglect their curtains,Dickinson
And we look farther on.,Dickinson
Italy stands the other side,Dickinson
While like a guard between,Dickinson
The solemn Alps,Dickinson
The siren Alps,Dickinson
Forever intervene!,Dickinson
XLI.,Dickinson
REMEMBRANCE.,Dickinson
Remembrance has a rear and front ,Dickinson
'T is something like a house;,Dickinson
It has a garret also,Dickinson
For refuse and the mouse,Dickinson
Besides the deepest cellar,Dickinson
That ever mason hewed;,Dickinson
Look to it by its fathoms,Dickinson
Ourselves be not pursued.,Dickinson
XLII.,Dickinson
To hang our head ostensibly,Dickinson
And subsequent to find,Dickinson
That such was not the posture,Dickinson
Of our immortal mind,Dickinson
Affords the sly presumption,Dickinson
That in so dense a fuzz,Dickinson
You too take cobweb attitudes,Dickinson
Upon a plane of gauze!,Dickinson
XLIII.,Dickinson
THE BRAIN.,Dickinson
The brain is wider than the sky,Dickinson
For put them side by side,Dickinson
The one the other will include,Dickinson
With ease and you beside.,Dickinson
The brain is deeper than the sea,Dickinson
For hold them blue to blue,Dickinson
The one the other will absorb,Dickinson
As sponges buckets do.,Dickinson
The brain is just the weight of God,Dickinson
For lift them pound for pound,Dickinson
And they will differ if they do,Dickinson
As syllable from sound.,Dickinson
XLIV.,Dickinson
The bone that has no marrow;,Dickinson
What ultimate for that?,Dickinson
It is not fit for table,Dickinson
For beggar or for cat.,Dickinson
A bone has obligations,Dickinson
A being has the same;,Dickinson
A marrowless assembly,Dickinson
Is culpabler than shame.,Dickinson
But how shall finished creatures,Dickinson
A function fresh obtain? ,Dickinson
Old Nicodemus' phantom,Dickinson
Confronting us again!,Dickinson
XLV.,Dickinson
THE PAST.,Dickinson
The past is such a curious creature,Dickinson
To look her in the face,Dickinson
A transport may reward us,Dickinson
Or a disgrace.,Dickinson
Unarmed if any meet her,Dickinson
I charge him fly!,Dickinson
Her rusty ammunition,Dickinson
Might yet reply!,Dickinson
XLVI.,Dickinson
To help our bleaker parts,Dickinson
Salubrious hours are given,Dickinson
Which if they do not fit for earth,Dickinson
Drill silently for heaven.,Dickinson
XLVII.,Dickinson
What soft cherubic creatures,Dickinson
These gentlewomen are!,Dickinson
One would as soon assault a plush,Dickinson
Or violate a star.,Dickinson
Such dimity convictions,Dickinson
A horror so refined,Dickinson
Of freckled human nature,Dickinson
Of Deity ashamed ,Dickinson
It's such a common glory,Dickinson
A fisherman's degree!,Dickinson
Redemption brittle lady,Dickinson
Be so ashamed of thee.,Dickinson
XLVIII.,Dickinson
DESIRE.,Dickinson
Who never wanted  maddest joy,Dickinson
Remains to him unknown,Dickinson
The banquet of abstemiousness,Dickinson
Surpasses that of wine.,Dickinson
Within its hope though yet ungrasped,Dickinson
Desire's perfect goal,Dickinson
No nearer lest reality,Dickinson
Should disenthrall thy soul.,Dickinson
XLIX.,Dickinson
PHILOSOPHY.,Dickinson
It might be easier,Dickinson
To fail with land in sight,Dickinson
Than gain my blue peninsula,Dickinson
To perish of delight.,Dickinson
L.,Dickinson
POWER.,Dickinson
You cannot put a fire out;,Dickinson
A thing that can ignite,Dickinson
Can go itself without a fan,Dickinson
Upon the slowest night.,Dickinson
You cannot fold a flood,Dickinson
And put it in a drawer ,Dickinson
Because the winds would find it out,Dickinson
And tell your cedar floor.,Dickinson
LI.,Dickinson
A modest lot a fame petite,Dickinson
A brief campaign of sting and sweet,Dickinson
Is plenty! Is enough!,Dickinson
A sailor's business is the shore,Dickinson
A soldier's  balls. Who asketh more,Dickinson
Must seek the neighboring life!,Dickinson
LII.,Dickinson
Is bliss then such abyss,Dickinson
I must not put my foot amiss,Dickinson
For fear I spoil my shoe?,Dickinson
I'd rather suit my foot,Dickinson
Than save my boot,Dickinson
For yet to buy another pair,Dickinson
Is possible,Dickinson
At any fair.,Dickinson
But bliss is sold just once;,Dickinson
The patent lost,Dickinson
None buy it any more.,Dickinson
LIII.,Dickinson
EXPERIENCE.,Dickinson
I stepped from plank to plank,Dickinson
So slow and cautiously;,Dickinson
The stars about my head I felt,Dickinson
About my feet the sea.,Dickinson
I knew not but the next,Dickinson
Would be my final inch ,Dickinson
This gave me that precarious gait,Dickinson
Some call experience.,Dickinson
LIV.,Dickinson
THANKSGIVING DAY.,Dickinson
One day is there of the series,Dickinson
Termed Thanksgiving day,Dickinson
Celebrated part at table,Dickinson
Part in memory.,Dickinson
Neither patriarch nor pussy,Dickinson
I dissect the play;,Dickinson
Seems it to my hooded thinking,Dickinson
Reflex holiday.,Dickinson
Had there been no sharp subtraction,Dickinson
From the early sum,Dickinson
Not an acre or a caption,Dickinson
Where was once a room,Dickinson
Not a mention whose small pebble,Dickinson
Wrinkled any bay ,Dickinson
Unto such were such assembly,Dickinson
'T were Thanksgiving day.,Dickinson
LV.,Dickinson
CHILDISH GRIEFS.,Dickinson
Softened by Time's consummate plush,Dickinson
How sleek the woe appears,Dickinson
That threatened childhood's citadel,Dickinson
And undermined the years!,Dickinson
Bisected now by bleaker griefs,Dickinson
We envy the despair,Dickinson
That devastated childhood's realm,Dickinson
So easy to repair.,Dickinson
II. LOVE.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
CONSECRATION.,Dickinson
Proud of my broken heart since thou didst break it,Dickinson
Proud of the pain I did not feel till thee,Dickinson
Proud of my night since thou with moons dost slake it,Dickinson
Not to partake thy passion my humility.,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
LOVE'S HUMILITY.,Dickinson
My worthiness is all my doubt,Dickinson
His merit all my fear,Dickinson
Contrasting which my qualities,Dickinson
Do lowlier appear;,Dickinson
Lest I should insufficient prove,Dickinson
For his beloved need,Dickinson
The chiefest apprehension,Dickinson
Within my loving creed.,Dickinson
So I the undivine abode,Dickinson
Of his elect content,Dickinson
Conform my soul as 't were a church,Dickinson
Unto her sacrament.,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
LOVE.,Dickinson
Love is anterior to life,Dickinson
Posterior to death,Dickinson
Initial of creation and,Dickinson
The exponent of breath.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
SATISFIED.,Dickinson
One blessing had I than the rest,Dickinson
So larger to my eyes,Dickinson
That I stopped gauging satisfied,Dickinson
For this enchanted size.,Dickinson
It was the limit of my dream,Dickinson
The focus of my prayer ,Dickinson
A perfect paralyzing bliss,Dickinson
Contented as despair.,Dickinson
I knew no more of want or cold,Dickinson
Phantasms both become,Dickinson
For this new value in the soul,Dickinson
Supremest earthly sum.,Dickinson
The heaven below the heaven above,Dickinson
Obscured with ruddier hue.,Dickinson
The judgment perished too.,Dickinson
Why joys so scantily disburse,Dickinson
Why Paradise defer,Dickinson
Why floods are served to us in bowls ,Dickinson
I speculate no more.,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
WITH A FLOWER.,Dickinson
When roses cease to bloom dear,Dickinson
And violets are done,Dickinson
Have passed beyond the sun,Dickinson
The hand that paused to gather,Dickinson
Upon this summer's day,Dickinson
Will idle lie in Auburn ,Dickinson
Then take my flower pray!,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
SONG.,Dickinson
Summer for thee grant I may be,Dickinson
When summer days are flown!,Dickinson
Thy music still when whippoorwill,Dickinson
And oriole are done!,Dickinson
For thee to bloom I'll skip the tomb,Dickinson
And sow my blossoms o'er!,Dickinson
Pray gather me Anemone,Dickinson
Thy flower forevermore!,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
LOYALTY.,Dickinson
Split the lark and you'll find the music,Dickinson
Bulb after bulb in silver rolled,Dickinson
Scantily dealt to the summer morning,Dickinson
Saved for your ear when lutes be old.,Dickinson
Loose the flood you shall find it patent,Dickinson
Gush after gush reserved for you;,Dickinson
Scarlet experiment! sceptic Thomas,Dickinson
Now do you doubt that your bird was true?,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
To lose thee sweeter than to gain,Dickinson
All other hearts I knew.,Dickinson
T is true the drought is destitute,Dickinson
But then I had the dew!,Dickinson
The Caspian has its realms of sand,Dickinson
Its other realm of sea;,Dickinson
Without the sterile perquisite,Dickinson
No Caspian could be.,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
Poor little heart!,Dickinson
Did they forget thee?,Dickinson
Then dinna care! Then dinna care!,Dickinson
Proud little heart!,Dickinson
Did they forsake thee?,Dickinson
Be debonair! Be debonair!,Dickinson
Frail little heart!,Dickinson
I would not break thee,Dickinson
Could'st credit me? Could'st credit me?,Dickinson
Gay little heart!,Dickinson
Like morning glory,Dickinson
Thou'll wilted be; thou'll wilted be!,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
FORGOTTEN.,Dickinson
There is a word,Dickinson
Which bears a sword,Dickinson
Can pierce an armed man.,Dickinson
It hurls its barbed syllables,Dickinson
At once is mute again.,Dickinson
But where it fell,Dickinson
The saved will tell,Dickinson
On patriotic day,Dickinson
Some epauletted brother,Dickinson
Gave his breath away.,Dickinson
Wherever runs the breathless sun,Dickinson
Wherever roams the day,Dickinson
There is its noiseless onset,Dickinson
There is its victory!,Dickinson
Behold the keenest marksman!,Dickinson
The most accomplished shot!,Dickinson
Time's sublimest target,Dickinson
Is a soul 'forgot'!,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
I've got an arrow here;,Dickinson
Loving the hand that sent it,Dickinson
I the dart revere.,Dickinson
Fell they will say in 'skirmish'!,Dickinson
Vanquished my soul will know,Dickinson
By but a simple arrow,Dickinson
Sped by an archer's bow.,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
THE MASTER.,Dickinson
He fumbles at your spirit,Dickinson
As players at the keys,Dickinson
Before they drop full music on;,Dickinson
He stuns you by degrees,Dickinson
Prepares your brittle substance,Dickinson
For the ethereal blow,Dickinson
By fainter hammers further heard,Dickinson
Then nearer then so slow,Dickinson
Your breath has time to straighten,Dickinson
Your brain to bubble cool ,Dickinson
Deals one imperial thunderbolt,Dickinson
That scalps your naked soul.,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
Heart we will forget him!,Dickinson
You may forget the warmth he gave,Dickinson
I will forget the light.,Dickinson
When you have done pray tell me,Dickinson
That I my thoughts may dim;,Dickinson
Haste! lest while you're lagging,Dickinson
I may remember him!,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
Father I bring thee not myself ,Dickinson
That were the little load;,Dickinson
I bring thee the imperial heart,Dickinson
I had not strength to hold.,Dickinson
The heart I cherished in my own,Dickinson
Till mine too heavy grew,Dickinson
Yet strangest heavier since it went,Dickinson
Is it too large for you?,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
We outgrow love like other things,Dickinson
And put it in the drawer,Dickinson
Till it an antique fashion shows,Dickinson
Like costumes grandsires wore.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
Not with a club the heart is broken,Dickinson
Nor with a stone;,Dickinson
A whip so small you could not see it.,Dickinson
I've known,Dickinson
To lash the magic creature,Dickinson
Till it fell,Dickinson
Yet that whip's name too noble,Dickinson
Then to tell.,Dickinson
Magnanimous of bird,Dickinson
By boy descried,Dickinson
To sing unto the stone,Dickinson
Of which it died.,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
WHO?,Dickinson
My friend must be a bird,Dickinson
Because it flies!,Dickinson
Mortal my friend must be,Dickinson
Because it dies!,Dickinson
Barbs has it like a bee.,Dickinson
Ah curious friend,Dickinson
Thou puzzlest me!,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
He touched me so I live to know,Dickinson
That such a day permitted so,Dickinson
I groped upon his breast.,Dickinson
It was a boundless place to me,Dickinson
And silenced as the awful sea,Dickinson
Puts minor streams to rest.,Dickinson
And now I'm different from before,Dickinson
As if I breathed superior air,Dickinson
Or brushed a royal gown;,Dickinson
My feet too that had wandered so,Dickinson
My gypsy face transfigured now,Dickinson
To tenderer renown.,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
DREAMS.,Dickinson
Let me not mar that perfect dream,Dickinson
By an auroral stain,Dickinson
But so adjust my daily night,Dickinson
That it will come again.,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
NUMEN LUMEN.,Dickinson
I live with him I see his face;,Dickinson
I go no more away,Dickinson
For visitor or sundown;,Dickinson
Death's single privacy,Dickinson
The only one forestalling mine,Dickinson
And that by right that he,Dickinson
Presents a claim invisible,Dickinson
No wedlock granted me.,Dickinson
I live with him I hear his voice,Dickinson
To witness to the certainty,Dickinson
Of immortality,Dickinson
Taught me by Time  the lower way,Dickinson
Conviction every day ,Dickinson
That life like this is endless,Dickinson
Be judgment what it may.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
LONGING.,Dickinson
I envy seas whereon he rides,Dickinson
I envy spokes of wheels,Dickinson
Of chariots that him convey,Dickinson
I envy speechless hills,Dickinson
That gaze upon his journey;,Dickinson
How easy all can see,Dickinson
What is forbidden utterly,Dickinson
As heaven unto me!,Dickinson
I envy nests of sparrows,Dickinson
That dot his distant eaves,Dickinson
The wealthy fly upon his pane,Dickinson
The happy happy leaves,Dickinson
That just abroad his window,Dickinson
Have summer's leave to be,Dickinson
The earrings of Pizarro,Dickinson
Could not obtain for me.,Dickinson
I envy light that wakes him,Dickinson
And bells that boldly ring,Dickinson
To tell him it is noon abroad ,Dickinson
Myself his noon could bring,Dickinson
Yet interdict my blossom,Dickinson
And abrogate my bee,Dickinson
Lest noon in everlasting night,Dickinson
Drop Gabriel and me.,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
WEDDED.,Dickinson
A solemn thing it was I said,Dickinson
A woman white to be,Dickinson
And wear if God should count me fit,Dickinson
Her hallowed mystery.,Dickinson
A timid thing to drop a life,Dickinson
Into the purple well,Dickinson
Too plummetless that it come back,Dickinson
Eternity until.,Dickinson
III. NATURE.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
NATURE'S CHANGES.,Dickinson
The springtime's pallid landscape,Dickinson
Will glow like bright bouquet,Dickinson
Though drifted deep in parian,Dickinson
The lilacs bending many a year,Dickinson
With purple load will hang;,Dickinson
The bees will not forget the tune,Dickinson
Their old forefathers sang.,Dickinson
The rose will redden in the bog,Dickinson
The aster on the hill,Dickinson
Her everlasting fashion set,Dickinson
And covenant gentians frill,Dickinson
Till summer folds her miracle,Dickinson
As women do their gown,Dickinson
Or priests adjust the symbols,Dickinson
When sacrament is done.,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
THE TULIP.,Dickinson
She slept beneath a tree,Dickinson
Remembered but by me.,Dickinson
I touched her cradle mute;,Dickinson
She recognized the foot,Dickinson
Put on her carmine suit ,Dickinson
And see!,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
A light exists in spring,Dickinson
Not present on the year,Dickinson
At any other period.,Dickinson
When March is scarcely here,Dickinson
A color stands abroad,Dickinson
On solitary hills,Dickinson
That science cannot overtake,Dickinson
But human nature feels.,Dickinson
It waits upon the lawn;,Dickinson
It shows the furthest tree,Dickinson
Upon the furthest slope we know;,Dickinson
It almost speaks to me.,Dickinson
Then as horizons step,Dickinson
Or noons report away,Dickinson
Without the formula of sound,Dickinson
It passes and we stay,Dickinson
A quality of loss,Dickinson
Affecting our content,Dickinson
As trade had suddenly encroached,Dickinson
Upon a sacrament.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
THE WAKING YEAR.,Dickinson
A lady red upon the hill,Dickinson
Her annual secret keeps;,Dickinson
A lady white within the field,Dickinson
In placid lily sleeps!,Dickinson
The tidy breezes with their brooms,Dickinson
Sweep vale and hill and tree!,Dickinson
Prithee my pretty housewives!,Dickinson
Who may expected be?,Dickinson
The neighbors do not yet suspect!,Dickinson
The woods exchange a smile ,Dickinson
Orchard and buttercup and bird ,Dickinson
In such a little while!,Dickinson
And yet how still the landscape stands,Dickinson
How nonchalant the wood,Dickinson
As if the resurrection,Dickinson
Were nothing very odd!,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
TO MARCH.,Dickinson
Dear March come in!,Dickinson
How glad I am!,Dickinson
I looked for you before.,Dickinson
Put down your hat ,Dickinson
You must have walked ,Dickinson
How out of breath you are!,Dickinson
Dear March how are you?,Dickinson
And the rest?,Dickinson
Did you leave Nature well?,Dickinson
Oh March come right upstairs with me,Dickinson
I have so much to tell!,Dickinson
I got your letter and the birds';,Dickinson
The maples never knew,Dickinson
That you were coming  I declare,Dickinson
How red their faces grew!,Dickinson
But March forgive me ,Dickinson
And all those hills,Dickinson
You left for me to hue;,Dickinson
There was no purple suitable,Dickinson
You took it all with you.,Dickinson
Who knocks? That April!,Dickinson
Lock the door!,Dickinson
I will not be pursued!,Dickinson
He stayed away a year to call,Dickinson
When I am occupied.,Dickinson
But trifles look so trivial,Dickinson
As soon as you have come,Dickinson
That blame is just as dear as praise,Dickinson
And praise as mere as blame.,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
MARCH.,Dickinson
We like March his shoes are purple,Dickinson
He is new and high;,Dickinson
Makes he mud for dog and peddler,Dickinson
Makes he forest dry;,Dickinson
Knows the adder's tongue his coming,Dickinson
And begets her spot.,Dickinson
Stands the sun so close and mighty,Dickinson
That our minds are hot.,Dickinson
News is he of all the others;,Dickinson
Bold it were to die,Dickinson
On his British sky.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
DAWN.,Dickinson
Not knowing when the dawn will come,Dickinson
I open every door;,Dickinson
Or has it feathers like a bird,Dickinson
Or billows like a shore?,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
A murmur in the trees to note,Dickinson
Not loud enough for wind;,Dickinson
A star not far enough to seek,Dickinson
Nor near enough to find;,Dickinson
A long long yellow on the lawn,Dickinson
A hubbub as of feet;,Dickinson
Not audible as ours to us,Dickinson
But dapperer more sweet;,Dickinson
A hurrying home of little men,Dickinson
To houses unperceived ,Dickinson
All this and more if I should tell,Dickinson
Would never be believed.,Dickinson
Of robins in the trundle bed,Dickinson
How many I espy,Dickinson
Whose nightgowns could not hide the wings,Dickinson
Although I heard them try!,Dickinson
But then I promised ne'er to tell;,Dickinson
How could I break my word?,Dickinson
So go your way and I'll go mine ,Dickinson
No fear you'll miss the road.,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
Morning is the place for dew,Dickinson
Corn is made at noon,Dickinson
After dinner light for flowers,Dickinson
Dukes for setting sun!,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
To my quick ear the leaves conferred;,Dickinson
The bushes they were bells;,Dickinson
I could not find a privacy,Dickinson
From Nature's sentinels.,Dickinson
In cave if I presumed to hide,Dickinson
The walls began to tell;,Dickinson
Creation seemed a mighty crack,Dickinson
To make me visible.,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
A ROSE.,Dickinson
A sepal petal and a thorn,Dickinson
Upon a common summer's morn,Dickinson
A flash of dew a bee or two,Dickinson
A breeze,Dickinson
A caper in the trees ,Dickinson
And I'm a rose!,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
High from the earth I heard a bird;,Dickinson
He trod upon the trees,Dickinson
As he esteemed them trifles,Dickinson
And then he spied a breeze,Dickinson
And situated softly,Dickinson
Upon a pile of wind,Dickinson
Which in a perturbation,Dickinson
Nature had left behind.,Dickinson
I gathered from his talk,Dickinson
Which both of benediction,Dickinson
And badinage partook,Dickinson
Without apparent burden,Dickinson
I learned in leafy wood,Dickinson
He was the faithful father,Dickinson
Of a dependent brood;,Dickinson
And this untoward transport,Dickinson
His remedy for care ,Dickinson
A contrast to our respites.,Dickinson
How different we are!,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
COBWEBS.,Dickinson
The spider as an artist,Dickinson
Has never been employed,Dickinson
Though his surpassing merit,Dickinson
Is freely certified,Dickinson
Throughout a Christian land.,Dickinson
Neglected son of genius,Dickinson
I take thee by the hand.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
A WELL.,Dickinson
What mystery pervades a well!,Dickinson
The water lives so far,Dickinson
Like neighbor from another world,Dickinson
Residing in a jar.,Dickinson
The grass does not appear afraid;,Dickinson
I often wonder he,Dickinson
Can stand so close and look so bold,Dickinson
At what is dread to me.,Dickinson
Related somehow they may be ,Dickinson
The sedge stands next the sea,Dickinson
Where he is floorless yet of fear,Dickinson
No evidence gives he.,Dickinson
But nature is a stranger yet;,Dickinson
The ones that cite her most,Dickinson
Have never passed her haunted house,Dickinson
Nor simplified her ghost.,Dickinson
To pity those that know her not,Dickinson
Is helped by the regret,Dickinson
That those who know her know her less,Dickinson
The nearer her they get.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
To make a prairie it takes a clover and one bee ,Dickinson
One clover and a bee,Dickinson
And revery.,Dickinson
The revery alone will do,Dickinson
If bees are few.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
THE WIND.,Dickinson
It's like the light ,Dickinson
A fashionless delight,Dickinson
It's like the bee ,Dickinson
A dateless melody.,Dickinson
It's like the woods,Dickinson
Private like breeze,Dickinson
Phraseless yet it stirs,Dickinson
The proudest trees.,Dickinson
It's like the morning ,Dickinson
Best when it's done ,Dickinson
The everlasting clocks,Dickinson
Chime noon.,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
A dew sufficed itself,Dickinson
And satisfied a leaf,Dickinson
And felt 'how vast a destiny!,Dickinson
How trivial is life!',Dickinson
The sun went out to work,Dickinson
The day went out to play,Dickinson
But not again that dew was seen,Dickinson
By physiognomy.,Dickinson
Whether by day abducted,Dickinson
Or emptied by the sun,Dickinson
Into the sea in passing,Dickinson
Eternally unknown.,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
THE WOODPECKER.,Dickinson
His bill an auger is,Dickinson
His head a cap and frill.,Dickinson
He laboreth at every tree ,Dickinson
A worm his utmost goal.,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
A SNAKE.,Dickinson
Sweet is the swamp with its secrets,Dickinson
Until we meet a snake;,Dickinson
T is then we sigh for houses,Dickinson
And our departure take,Dickinson
At that enthralling gallop,Dickinson
That only childhood knows.,Dickinson
A snake is summer's treason,Dickinson
And guile is where it goes.,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
Could I but ride indefinite,Dickinson
And visit only where I liked,Dickinson
And no man visit me,Dickinson
And flirt all day with buttercups,Dickinson
And marry whom I may,Dickinson
And dwell a little everywhere,Dickinson
Or better run away,Dickinson
With no police to follow,Dickinson
Or chase me if I do,Dickinson
Till I should jump peninsulas,Dickinson
To get away from you ,Dickinson
I said but just to be a bee,Dickinson
Upon a raft of air,Dickinson
And row in nowhere all day long,Dickinson
And anchor off the bar,Dickinson
What liberty! So captives deem,Dickinson
Who tight in dungeons are.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
THE MOON.,Dickinson
The moon was but a chin of gold,Dickinson
A night or two ago,Dickinson
And now she turns her perfect face,Dickinson
Upon the world below.,Dickinson
Her forehead is of amplest blond;,Dickinson
Her cheek like beryl stone;,Dickinson
Her eye unto the summer dew,Dickinson
The likest I have known.,Dickinson
Her lips of amber never part;,Dickinson
But what must be the smile,Dickinson
Upon her friend she could bestow,Dickinson
Were such her silver will!,Dickinson
And what a privilege to be,Dickinson
But the remotest star!,Dickinson
For certainly her way might pass,Dickinson
Beside your twinkling door.,Dickinson
Her bonnet is the firmament,Dickinson
The stars the trinkets at her belt,Dickinson
Her dimities of blue.,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
THE BAT.,Dickinson
The bat is dun with wrinkled wings,Dickinson
Like fallow article,Dickinson
And not a song pervades his lips,Dickinson
Or none perceptible.,Dickinson
His small umbrella quaintly halved,Dickinson
Describing in the air,Dickinson
An arc alike inscrutable ,Dickinson
Elate philosopher!,Dickinson
Deputed from what firmament,Dickinson
Of what astute abode,Dickinson
Empowered with what malevolence,Dickinson
Auspiciously withheld.,Dickinson
To his adroit Creator,Dickinson
Ascribe no less the praise;,Dickinson
Beneficent believe me,Dickinson
His eccentricities.,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
THE BALLOON.,Dickinson
You've seen balloons set haven't you?,Dickinson
So stately they ascend,Dickinson
It is as swans discarded you,Dickinson
For duties diamond.,Dickinson
Their liquid feet go softly out,Dickinson
Upon a sea of blond;,Dickinson
They spurn the air as 't were too mean,Dickinson
For creatures so renowned.,Dickinson
Their ribbons just beyond the eye,Dickinson
They struggle some for breath,Dickinson
And yet the crowd applauds below;,Dickinson
They would not encore death.,Dickinson
The gilded creature strains and spins,Dickinson
Trips frantic in a tree,Dickinson
Tears open her imperial veins,Dickinson
And tumbles in the sea.,Dickinson
The crowd retire with an oath,Dickinson
The dust in streets goes down,Dickinson
''T was only a balloon.',Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
EVENING.,Dickinson
The cricket sang,Dickinson
And set the sun,Dickinson
And workmen finished one by one,Dickinson
Their seam the day upon.,Dickinson
The low grass loaded with the dew,Dickinson
The twilight stood as strangers do,Dickinson
With hat in hand polite and new,Dickinson
To stay as if or go.,Dickinson
A vastness as a neighbor came ,Dickinson
A wisdom without face or name,Dickinson
A peace as hemispheres at home ,Dickinson
And so the night became.,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
COCOON.,Dickinson
Drab habitation of whom?,Dickinson
Tabernacle or tomb,Dickinson
Or dome of worm,Dickinson
Or porch of gnome,Dickinson
Or some elf's catacomb?,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
SUNSET.,Dickinson
A sloop of amber slips away,Dickinson
Upon an ether sea,Dickinson
And wrecks in peace a purple tar,Dickinson
The son of ecstasy.,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
AURORA.,Dickinson
Of bronze and blaze,Dickinson
So adequate its forms,Dickinson
So preconcerted with itself,Dickinson
So distant to alarms ,Dickinson
An unconcern so sovereign,Dickinson
It paints my simple spirit,Dickinson
With tints of majesty,Dickinson
Till I take vaster attitudes,Dickinson
And strut upon my stem,Dickinson
Disdaining men and oxygen,Dickinson
For arrogance of them.,Dickinson
My splendors are menagerie;,Dickinson
But their competeless show,Dickinson
Will entertain the centuries,Dickinson
When I am long ago,Dickinson
An island in dishonored grass,Dickinson
Whom none but daisies know.,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
THE COMING OF NIGHT.,Dickinson
How the old mountains drip with sunset,Dickinson
And the brake of dun!,Dickinson
How the hemlocks are tipped in tinsel,Dickinson
By the wizard sun!,Dickinson
How the old steeples hand the scarlet,Dickinson
Till the ball is full ,Dickinson
Have I the lip of the flamingo,Dickinson
That I dare to tell?,Dickinson
Then how the fire ebbs like billows,Dickinson
Touching all the grass,Dickinson
With a departing sapphire feature,Dickinson
As if a duchess pass!,Dickinson
How a small dusk crawls on the village,Dickinson
Till the houses blot;,Dickinson
And the odd flambeaux no men carry,Dickinson
Glimmer on the spot!,Dickinson
Now it is night in nest and kennel,Dickinson
And where was the wood,Dickinson
Just a dome of abyss is nodding,Dickinson
Into solitude! ,Dickinson
These are the visions baffled Guido;,Dickinson
Titian never told;,Dickinson
Domenichino dropped the pencil,Dickinson
Powerless to unfold.,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
AFTERMATH.,Dickinson
The murmuring of bees has ceased;,Dickinson
But murmuring of some,Dickinson
Posterior prophetic,Dickinson
Has simultaneous come ,Dickinson
The lower metres of the year,Dickinson
When nature's laugh is done ,Dickinson
The Revelations of the book,Dickinson
Whose Genesis is June.,Dickinson
IV. TIME AND ETERNITY.,Dickinson
I.,Dickinson
This world is not conclusion;,Dickinson
A sequel stands beyond,Dickinson
Invisible as music,Dickinson
But positive as sound.,Dickinson
It beckons and it baffles;,Dickinson
Philosophies don't know,Dickinson
And through a riddle at the last,Dickinson
Sagacity must go.,Dickinson
To guess it puzzles scholars;,Dickinson
To gain it men have shown,Dickinson
Contempt of generations,Dickinson
And crucifixion known.,Dickinson
II.,Dickinson
We learn in the retreating,Dickinson
How vast an one,Dickinson
Was recently among us.,Dickinson
A perished sun,Dickinson
Endears in the departure,Dickinson
How doubly more,Dickinson
Than all the golden presence,Dickinson
It was before!,Dickinson
III.,Dickinson
They say that 'time assuages' ,Dickinson
Time never did assuage;,Dickinson
An actual suffering strengthens,Dickinson
As sinews do with age.,Dickinson
Time is a test of trouble,Dickinson
But not a remedy.,Dickinson
If such it prove it prove too,Dickinson
There was no malady.,Dickinson
IV.,Dickinson
We cover thee sweet face.,Dickinson
Not that we tire of thee,Dickinson
But that thyself fatigue of us;,Dickinson
Remember as thou flee,Dickinson
We follow thee until,Dickinson
Thou notice us no more,Dickinson
And then reluctant turn away,Dickinson
To con thee o'er and o'er,Dickinson
And blame the scanty love,Dickinson
We were content to show,Dickinson
Augmented sweet a hundred fold,Dickinson
If thou would'st take it now.,Dickinson
V.,Dickinson
ENDING.,Dickinson
That is solemn we have ended ,Dickinson
Be it but a play,Dickinson
Or a glee among the garrets,Dickinson
Or a holiday,Dickinson
Or a leaving home; or later,Dickinson
Parting with a world,Dickinson
We have understood for better,Dickinson
Still it be unfurled.,Dickinson
VI.,Dickinson
The stimulus beyond the grave,Dickinson
His countenance to see,Dickinson
Supports me like imperial drams,Dickinson
Afforded royally.,Dickinson
VII.,Dickinson
Given in marriage unto thee,Dickinson
Oh thou celestial host!,Dickinson
Bride of the Father and the Son,Dickinson
Bride of the Holy Ghost!,Dickinson
Other betrothal shall dissolve,Dickinson
Wedlock of will decay;,Dickinson
Only the keeper of this seal,Dickinson
Conquers mortality.,Dickinson
VIII.,Dickinson
That such have died enables us,Dickinson
The tranquiller to die;,Dickinson
That such have lived certificate,Dickinson
For immortality.,Dickinson
IX.,Dickinson
They won't frown always  some sweet day,Dickinson
When I forget to tease,Dickinson
They'll recollect how cold I looked,Dickinson
And how I just said 'please.',Dickinson
Then they will hasten to the door,Dickinson
To call the little child,Dickinson
Who cannot thank them for the ice,Dickinson
That on her lisping piled.,Dickinson
X.,Dickinson
IMMORTALITY.,Dickinson
It is an honorable thought,Dickinson
And makes one lift one's hat,Dickinson
As one encountered gentlefolk,Dickinson
Upon a daily street,Dickinson
That we've immortal place,Dickinson
Though pyramids decay,Dickinson
And kingdoms like the orchard,Dickinson
Flit russetly away.,Dickinson
XI.,Dickinson
The distance that the dead have gone,Dickinson
Does not at first appear;,Dickinson
Their coming back seems possible,Dickinson
For many an ardent year.,Dickinson
And then that we have followed them,Dickinson
We more than half suspect,Dickinson
So intimate have we become,Dickinson
With their dear retrospect.,Dickinson
XII.,Dickinson
How dare the robins sing,Dickinson
When men and women hear,Dickinson
Who since they went to their account,Dickinson
Have settled with the year! ,Dickinson
Paid all that life had earned,Dickinson
In one consummate bill,Dickinson
And now what life or death can do,Dickinson
Is immaterial.,Dickinson
Insulting is the sun,Dickinson
To him whose mortal light,Dickinson
Beguiled of immortality,Dickinson
Bequeaths him to the night.,Dickinson
In deference to him,Dickinson
Extinct be every hum,Dickinson
Whose garden wrestles with the dew,Dickinson
At daybreak overcome!,Dickinson
XIII.,Dickinson
DEATH.,Dickinson
Death is like the insect,Dickinson
Menacing the tree,Dickinson
Competent to kill it,Dickinson
But decoyed may be.,Dickinson
Bait it with the balsam,Dickinson
Seek it with the knife,Dickinson
Baffle if it cost you,Dickinson
Everything in life.,Dickinson
Then if it have burrowed,Dickinson
Out of reach of skill,Dickinson
Ring the tree and leave it ,Dickinson
'T is the vermin's will.,Dickinson
XIV.,Dickinson
UNWARNED.,Dickinson
T is sunrise little maid hast thou,Dickinson
No station in the day?,Dickinson
T was not thy wont to hinder so ,Dickinson
Retrieve thine industry.,Dickinson
T is noon my little maid alas!,Dickinson
And art thou sleeping yet?,Dickinson
The lily waiting to be wed,Dickinson
The bee dost thou forget?,Dickinson
My little maid 't is night; alas,Dickinson
That night should be to thee,Dickinson
Instead of morning! Hadst thou broached,Dickinson
Thy little plan to me,Dickinson
Dissuade thee if I could not sweet,Dickinson
I might have aided thee.,Dickinson
XV.,Dickinson
Each that we lose takes part of us;,Dickinson
A crescent still abides,Dickinson
Which like the moon some turbid night,Dickinson
Is summoned by the tides.,Dickinson
XVI.,Dickinson
Not any higher stands the grave,Dickinson
For heroes than for men;,Dickinson
Not any nearer for the child,Dickinson
This latest leisure equal lulls,Dickinson
The beggar and his queen;,Dickinson
Propitiate this democrat,Dickinson
By summer's gracious mien.,Dickinson
XVII.,Dickinson
ASLEEP.,Dickinson
As far from pity as complaint,Dickinson
As cool to speech as stone,Dickinson
As numb to revelation,Dickinson
As if my trade were bone.,Dickinson
As far from time as history,Dickinson
As children to the rainbow's scarf,Dickinson
Or sunset's yellow play,Dickinson
To eyelids in the sepulchre.,Dickinson
How still the dancer lies,Dickinson
While color's revelations break,Dickinson
And blaze the butterflies!,Dickinson
XVIII.,Dickinson
THE SPIRIT.,Dickinson
T is whiter than an Indian pipe,Dickinson
'T is dimmer than a lace;,Dickinson
No stature has it like a fog,Dickinson
When you approach the place.,Dickinson
Not any voice denotes it here,Dickinson
Or intimates it there;,Dickinson
A spirit how doth it accost?,Dickinson
What customs hath the air?,Dickinson
This limitless hyperbole,Dickinson
Each one of us shall be;,Dickinson
It be not tragedy!,Dickinson
XIX.,Dickinson
THE MONUMENT.,Dickinson
She laid her docile crescent down,Dickinson
And this mechanic stone,Dickinson
Still states to dates that have forgot,Dickinson
The news that she is gone.,Dickinson
So constant to its stolid trust,Dickinson
The shaft that never knew,Dickinson
It shames the constancy that fled,Dickinson
Before its emblem flew.,Dickinson
XX.,Dickinson
Bless God he went as soldiers,Dickinson
His musket on his breast;,Dickinson
Grant God he charge the bravest,Dickinson
Of all the martial blest.,Dickinson
Please God might I behold him,Dickinson
In epauletted white,Dickinson
I should not fear the foe then,Dickinson
I should not fear the fight.,Dickinson
XXI.,Dickinson
Immortal is an ample word,Dickinson
When what we need is by,Dickinson
But when it leaves us for a time,Dickinson
'T is a necessity.,Dickinson
Of heaven above the firmest proof,Dickinson
We fundamental know,Dickinson
Except for its marauding hand,Dickinson
It had been heaven below.,Dickinson
XXII.,Dickinson
Where every bird is bold to go,Dickinson
And bees abashless play,Dickinson
The foreigner before he knocks,Dickinson
Must thrust the tears away.,Dickinson
XXIII.,Dickinson
The grave my little cottage is,Dickinson
Where keeping house for thee,Dickinson
I make my parlor orderly,Dickinson
And lay the marble tea,Dickinson
For two divided briefly,Dickinson
A cycle it may be,Dickinson
Till everlasting life unite,Dickinson
In strong society.,Dickinson
XXIV.,Dickinson
This was in the white of the year,Dickinson
That was in the green,Dickinson
Drifts were as difficult then to think,Dickinson
As daisies now to be seen.,Dickinson
Looking back is best that is left,Dickinson
Or if it be before,Dickinson
Retrospection is prospect's half,Dickinson
Sometimes almost more.,Dickinson
XXV.,Dickinson
Sweet hours have perished here;,Dickinson
This is a mighty room;,Dickinson
Within its precincts hopes have played ,Dickinson
Now shadows in the tomb.,Dickinson
XXVI.,Dickinson
Me! Come! My dazzled face,Dickinson
In such a shining place!,Dickinson
Me! Hear! My foreign ear,Dickinson
The sounds of welcome near!,Dickinson
The saints shall meet,Dickinson
Our bashful feet.,Dickinson
My holiday shall be,Dickinson
That they remember me;,Dickinson
My paradise the fame,Dickinson
That they pronounce my name.,Dickinson
XXVII.,Dickinson
INVISIBLE.,Dickinson
From us she wandered now a year,Dickinson
Her tarrying unknown;,Dickinson
If wilderness prevent her feet,Dickinson
Or that ethereal zone,Dickinson
No eye hath seen and lived,Dickinson
We ignorant must be.,Dickinson
We only know what time of year,Dickinson
We took the mystery.,Dickinson
XXVIII.,Dickinson
I wish I knew that woman's name,Dickinson
So when she comes this way,Dickinson
To hold my life and hold my ears,Dickinson
For fear I hear her say,Dickinson
She's 'sorry I am dead' again,Dickinson
Just when the grave and I,Dickinson
Have sobbed ourselves almost to sleep ,Dickinson
Our only lullaby.,Dickinson
XXIX.,Dickinson
TRYING TO FORGET.,Dickinson
Bereaved of all I went abroad,Dickinson
No less bereaved to be,Dickinson
Upon a new peninsula ,Dickinson
The grave preceded me,Dickinson
Obtained my lodgings ere myself,Dickinson
And when I sought my bed,Dickinson
The grave it was reposed upon,Dickinson
The pillow for my head.,Dickinson
I waked to find it first awake,Dickinson
I rose  it followed me;,Dickinson
I tried to drop it in the crowd,Dickinson
To lose it in the sea,Dickinson
In cups of artificial drowse,Dickinson
To sleep its shape away ,Dickinson
The grave was finished but the spade,Dickinson
Remained in memory.,Dickinson
XXX.,Dickinson
I felt a funeral in my brain,Dickinson
And mourners to and fro,Dickinson
Kept treading treading till it seemed,Dickinson
That sense was breaking through.,Dickinson
And when they all were seated,Dickinson
A service like a drum,Dickinson
Kept beating beating till I thought,Dickinson
My mind was going numb.,Dickinson
And then I heard them lift a box,Dickinson
And creak across my soul,Dickinson
With those same boots of lead again.,Dickinson
Then space began to toll,Dickinson
As all the heavens were a bell,Dickinson
And Being but an ear,Dickinson
And I and silence some strange race,Dickinson
Wrecked solitary here.,Dickinson
XXXI.,Dickinson
I meant to find her when I came;,Dickinson
Death had the same design;,Dickinson
But the success was his it seems,Dickinson
And the discomfit mine.,Dickinson
I meant to tell her how I longed,Dickinson
For just this single time;,Dickinson
But Death had told her so the first,Dickinson
And she had hearkened him.,Dickinson
To wander now is my abode;,Dickinson
To rest  to rest would be,Dickinson
A privilege of hurricane,Dickinson
To memory and me.,Dickinson
XXXII.,Dickinson
WAITING.,Dickinson
I sing to use the waiting,Dickinson
My bonnet but to tie,Dickinson
And shut the door unto my house;,Dickinson
No more to do have I,Dickinson
Till his best step approaching,Dickinson
We journey to the day,Dickinson
And tell each other how we sang,Dickinson
To keep the dark away.,Dickinson
XXXIII.,Dickinson
A sickness of this world it most occasions,Dickinson
When best men die;,Dickinson
A wishfulness their far condition,Dickinson
To occupy.,Dickinson
A chief indifference as foreign,Dickinson
A world must be,Dickinson
Themselves forsake contented,Dickinson
For Deity.,Dickinson
XXXIV.,Dickinson
Superfluous were the sun,Dickinson
When excellence is dead;,Dickinson
He were superfluous every day,Dickinson
For every day is said,Dickinson
That syllable whose faith,Dickinson
Just saves it from despair,Dickinson
And whose 'I'll meet you' hesitates,Dickinson
If love inquire 'Where?',Dickinson
Upon his dateless fame,Dickinson
Our periods may lie,Dickinson
As stars that drop anonymous,Dickinson
From an abundant sky.,Dickinson
XXXV.,Dickinson
So proud she was to die,Dickinson
It made us all ashamed,Dickinson
That what we cherished so unknown,Dickinson
To her desire seemed.,Dickinson
So satisfied to go,Dickinson
Where none of us should be,Dickinson
Immediately that anguish stooped,Dickinson
Almost to jealousy.,Dickinson
XXXVI.,Dickinson
FAREWELL.,Dickinson
Tie the strings to my life my Lord,Dickinson
Then I am ready to go!,Dickinson
Just a look at the horses ,Dickinson
Rapid! That will do!,Dickinson
Put me in on the firmest side,Dickinson
So I shall never fall;,Dickinson
For we must ride to the Judgment,Dickinson
And it's partly down hill.,Dickinson
And never I mind the sea;,Dickinson
Held fast in everlasting race,Dickinson
By my own choice and thee.,Dickinson
And the world I used to know;,Dickinson
And kiss the hills for me just once;,Dickinson
Now I am ready to go!,Dickinson
XXXVII.,Dickinson
The dying need but little dear ,Dickinson
A glass of water's all,Dickinson
A flower's unobtrusive face,Dickinson
To punctuate the wall,Dickinson
A fan perhaps a friend's regret,Dickinson
And certainly that one,Dickinson
No color in the rainbow,Dickinson
Perceives when you are gone.,Dickinson
XXXVIII.,Dickinson
DEAD.,Dickinson
There's something quieter than sleep,Dickinson
Within this inner room!,Dickinson
It wears a sprig upon its breast,Dickinson
And will not tell its name.,Dickinson
Some touch it and some kiss it,Dickinson
Some chafe its idle hand;,Dickinson
It has a simple gravity,Dickinson
I do not understand!,Dickinson
Chat of the 'early dead',Dickinson
We prone to periphrasis,Dickinson
Remark that birds have fled!,Dickinson
XXXIX.,Dickinson
The soul should always stand ajar,Dickinson
That if the heaven inquire,Dickinson
He will not be obliged to wait,Dickinson
Or shy of troubling her.,Dickinson
Depart before the host has slid,Dickinson
The bolt upon the door,Dickinson
To seek for the accomplished guest ,Dickinson
Her visitor no more.,Dickinson
XL.,Dickinson
Three weeks passed since I had seen her ,Dickinson
Some disease had vexed;,Dickinson
'T was with text and village singing,Dickinson
I beheld her next,Dickinson
And a company  our pleasure,Dickinson
To discourse alone;,Dickinson
Gracious now to me as any,Dickinson
Gracious unto none.,Dickinson
Borne without dissent of either,Dickinson
To the parish night;,Dickinson
Of the separated people,Dickinson
Which are out of sight?,Dickinson
XLI.,Dickinson
I breathed enough to learn the trick,Dickinson
And now removed from air,Dickinson
I simulate the breath so well,Dickinson
That one to be quite sure,Dickinson
The lungs are stirless must descend,Dickinson
Among the cunning cells,Dickinson
And touch the pantomime himself.,Dickinson
How cool the bellows feels!,Dickinson
XLII.,Dickinson
I wonder if the sepulchre,Dickinson
Is not a lonesome way,Dickinson
When men and boys and larks and June,Dickinson
Go down the fields to hay!,Dickinson
XLIII.,Dickinson
JOY IN DEATH.,Dickinson
If tolling bell I ask the cause.,Dickinson
A soul has gone to God',Dickinson
I'm answered in a lonesome tone;,Dickinson
Is heaven then so sad?,Dickinson
That bells should joyful ring to tell,Dickinson
A soul had gone to heaven,Dickinson
Would seem to me the proper way,Dickinson
A good news should be given.,Dickinson
XLIV.,Dickinson
If I may have it when it's dead,Dickinson
I will contented be;,Dickinson
If just as soon as breath is out,Dickinson
It shall belong to me,Dickinson
Until they lock it in the grave,Dickinson
T is bliss I cannot weigh,Dickinson
For though they lock thee in the grave,Dickinson
Myself can hold the key.,Dickinson
Think of it lover! I and thee,Dickinson
Permitted face to face to be;,Dickinson
After a life a death we'll say ,Dickinson
For death was that and this is thee.,Dickinson
XLV.,Dickinson
Before the ice is in the pools,Dickinson
Before the skaters go,Dickinson
Or any cheek at nightfall,Dickinson
Is tarnished by the snow,Dickinson
Before the fields have finished,Dickinson
Before the Christmas tree,Dickinson
Wonder upon wonder,Dickinson
Will arrive to me!,Dickinson
What we touch the hems of,Dickinson
On a summer's day;,Dickinson
What is only walking,Dickinson
That which sings so speaks so,Dickinson
When there's no one here ,Dickinson
Will the frock I wept in,Dickinson
Answer me to wear?,Dickinson
XLVI.,Dickinson
DYING.,Dickinson
I heard a fly buzz when I died;,Dickinson
The stillness round my form,Dickinson
Was like the stillness in the air,Dickinson
Between the heaves of storm.,Dickinson
The eyes beside had wrung them dry,Dickinson
And breaths were gathering sure,Dickinson
For that last onset when the king,Dickinson
Be witnessed in his power.,Dickinson
I willed my keepsakes signed away,Dickinson
What portion of me I,Dickinson
Could make assignable  and then,Dickinson
There interposed a fly,Dickinson
With blue uncertain stumbling buzz,Dickinson
Between the light and me;,Dickinson
And then the windows failed and then,Dickinson
I could not see to see.,Dickinson
XLVII.,Dickinson
Adrift! A little boat adrift!,Dickinson
And night is coming down!,Dickinson
Will no one guide a little boat,Dickinson
Unto the nearest town?,Dickinson
So sailors say on yesterday,Dickinson
Just as the dusk was brown,Dickinson
One little boat gave up its strife,Dickinson
And gurgled down and down.,Dickinson
But angels say on yesterday,Dickinson
Just as the dawn was red,Dickinson
One little boat o'erspent with gales,Dickinson
Retrimmed its masts redecked its sails,Dickinson
Exultant onward sped!,Dickinson
XLVIII.,Dickinson
There's been a death in the opposite house,Dickinson
I know it by the numb look,Dickinson
Such houses have alway.,Dickinson
The neighbors rustle in and out,Dickinson
The doctor drives away.,Dickinson
A window opens like a pod,Dickinson
Abrupt mechanically;,Dickinson
Somebody flings a mattress out ,Dickinson
The children hurry by;,Dickinson
They wonder if It died on that ,Dickinson
I used to when a boy.,Dickinson
The minister goes stiffly in,Dickinson
As if the house were his,Dickinson
And he owned all the mourners now,Dickinson
And little boys besides;,Dickinson
And then the milliner and the man,Dickinson
Of the appalling trade,Dickinson
To take the measure of the house.,Dickinson
There'll be that dark parade,Dickinson
Of tassels and of coaches soon;,Dickinson
It's easy as a sign ,Dickinson
The intuition of the news,Dickinson
In just a country town.,Dickinson
XLIX.,Dickinson
We never know we go  when we are going,Dickinson
We jest and shut the door;,Dickinson
Fate following behind us bolts it,Dickinson
And we accost no more.,Dickinson
L.,Dickinson
THE SOUL'S STORM.,Dickinson
It struck me every day,Dickinson
The lightning was as new,Dickinson
As if the cloud that instant slit,Dickinson
And let the fire through.,Dickinson
It burned me in the night,Dickinson
It blistered in my dream;,Dickinson
It sickened fresh upon my sight,Dickinson
With every morning's beam.,Dickinson
I thought that storm was brief ,Dickinson
The maddest quickest by;,Dickinson
But Nature lost the date of this,Dickinson
And left it in the sky.,Dickinson
LI.,Dickinson
Water is taught by thirst;,Dickinson
Land by the oceans passed;,Dickinson
Transport by throe;,Dickinson
Peace by its battles told;,Dickinson
Love by memorial mould;,Dickinson
Birds by the snow.,Dickinson
LII.,Dickinson
THIRST.,Dickinson
We thirst at first  't is Nature's act;,Dickinson
And later when we die,Dickinson
A little water supplicate,Dickinson
Of fingers going by.,Dickinson
It intimates the finer want,Dickinson
Whose adequate supply,Dickinson
Is that great water in the west,Dickinson
Termed immortality.,Dickinson
LIII.,Dickinson
A clock stopped  not the mantel's;,Dickinson
Geneva's farthest skill,Dickinson
Can't put the puppet bowing,Dickinson
That just now dangled still.,Dickinson
An awe came on the trinket!,Dickinson
The figures hunched with pain,Dickinson
Then quivered out of decimals,Dickinson
Into degreeless noon.,Dickinson
It will not stir for doctors,Dickinson
This pendulum of snow;,Dickinson
The shopman importunes it,Dickinson
While cool concernless No,Dickinson
Nods from the gilded pointers,Dickinson
Nods from the seconds slim,Dickinson
Decades of arrogance between,Dickinson
The dial life and him.,Dickinson
LIV.,Dickinson
CHARLOTTE BRONT'S GRAVE.,Dickinson
All overgrown by cunning moss,Dickinson
All interspersed with weed,Dickinson
The little cage of 'Currer Bell',Dickinson
In quiet Haworth laid.,Dickinson
This bird observing others,Dickinson
When frosts too sharp became,Dickinson
Retire to other latitudes,Dickinson
Quietly did the same,Dickinson
But differed in returning;,Dickinson
Since Yorkshire hills are green,Dickinson
Yet not in all the nests I meet,Dickinson
Can nightingale be seen.,Dickinson
Gathered from many wanderings,Dickinson
Gethsemane can tell,Dickinson
Through what transporting anguish,Dickinson
She reached the asphodel!,Dickinson
Soft fall the sounds of Eden,Dickinson
Upon her puzzled ear;,Dickinson
Oh what an afternoon for heaven,Dickinson
When 'Bront�' entered there!,Dickinson
LV.,Dickinson
A toad can die of light!,Dickinson
Death is the common right,Dickinson
Of toads and men ,Dickinson
Of earl and midge,Dickinson
The privilege.,Dickinson
Why swagger then?,Dickinson
The gnat's supremacy,Dickinson
Is large as thine.,Dickinson
LVI.,Dickinson
Far from love the Heavenly Father,Dickinson
Leads the chosen child;,Dickinson
Oftener through realm of briar,Dickinson
Than the meadow mild,Dickinson
Oftener by the claw of dragon,Dickinson
Than the hand of friend,Dickinson
Guides the little one predestined,Dickinson
To the native land.,Dickinson
LVII.,Dickinson
SLEEPING.,Dickinson
A long long sleep a famous sleep,Dickinson
That makes no show for dawn,Dickinson
By stretch of limb or stir of lid ,Dickinson
An independent one.,Dickinson
Was ever idleness like this?,Dickinson
Within a hut of stone,Dickinson
To bask the centuries away,Dickinson
Nor once look up for noon?,Dickinson
LVIII.,Dickinson
RETROSPECT.,Dickinson
'T was just this time last year I died.,Dickinson
I know I heard the corn,Dickinson
When I was carried by the farms ,Dickinson
It had the tassels on.,Dickinson
I thought how yellow it would look,Dickinson
When Richard went to mill;,Dickinson
And then I wanted to get out,Dickinson
But something held my will.,Dickinson
I thought just how red apples wedged,Dickinson
The stubble's joints between;,Dickinson
And carts went stooping round the fields,Dickinson
To take the pumpkins in.,Dickinson
I wondered which would miss me least,Dickinson
And when Thanksgiving came,Dickinson
If father'd multiply the plates,Dickinson
To make an even sum.,Dickinson
And if my stocking hung too high,Dickinson
Would it blur the Christmas glee,Dickinson
That not a Santa Claus could reach,Dickinson
The altitude of me?,Dickinson
But this sort grieved myself and so,Dickinson
I thought how it would be,Dickinson
When just this time some perfect year,Dickinson
Themselves should come to me.,Dickinson
LIX.,Dickinson
ETERNITY.,Dickinson
On this wondrous sea,Dickinson
Sailing silently,Dickinson
Ho! pilot ho!,Dickinson
Knowest thou the shore,Dickinson
Where no breakers roar,Dickinson
Where the storm is o'er?,Dickinson
In the silent west,Dickinson
Many sails at rest,Dickinson
Their anchors fast;,Dickinson
Thither I pilot thee ,Dickinson
Land ho! Eternity!,Dickinson
Ashore at last!,Dickinson
When somebody loved me,Disney
Everything was beautiful,Disney
Every hour we spent together,Disney
Lives within my heart And when she was sad,Disney
I was there to dry her tears,Disney
And when she was happy so was I,Disney
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall,Disney
We had each other that was all,Disney
Just she and I together,Disney
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely,Disney
I was there to comfort her,Disney
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by,Disney
I stayed the same,Disney
She began to drift away,Disney
I was left alone Still I waited for the day,Disney
When she'd say,Disney
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten,Disney
Never thought she'd look my way,Disney
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do,Disney
Like she loved me,Disney
When she loved me When somebody loved me,Disney
Everything was beautiful,Disney
Every hour we spent together,Disney
Lives within my heart When she loved me hey Sentimentos so,Disney
F�ceis de mudar,Disney
Mesmo entre quem,Disney
No v� que algu�m,Disney
Pode ser seu par Basta um olhar,Disney
Que o outro no espera,Disney
Para assustar e at� perturbar,Disney
Mesmo a bela e a fera Sentimento assim,Disney
Sempre � uma surpresa,Disney
Quando ele vem,Disney
Nada o det�m,Disney

Para nos trazer,Disney
Novas sensa�es,Disney

Para a bela e a fera Para a bela e a fera Tale as old as time,Disney
True as it can be,Disney
Barely even friends,Disney
Then somebody bends,Disney
Unexpectedly. Just a little change,Disney
Small to say the least,Disney
Both a little scared,Disney
Neither one prepared,Disney
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same,Disney
Ever a surprise,Disney
Ever as before,Disney
Ever just as sure,Disney
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time,Disney
Tune as old as song,Disney
Bittersweet and strange,Disney
Finding you can change,Disney
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun,Disney
Rising in the east,Disney
Tale as old as time,Disney
Song as old as rhyme,Disney
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time,Disney
Song as old as rhyme,Disney
Beauty and the Beast Look at this stuff isn't it neat?,Disney
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?,Disney
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl,Disney
The girl who has everything?,Disney
Look at this trove treasures untold,Disney
How many wonders can one cavern hold?,Disney
Lookin' around here you'd think,Disney
Sure she's got everything I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty,Disney
You want thingamabobs?,Disney
I got twenty,Disney
But who cares?,Disney
No big deal,Disney
I want more I want to be where the people are,Disney
I want to see,Disney
Want to see 'em dancing,Disney
Walking around on those,Disney
Whadd'ya call 'em? Oh feet,Disney
Flipping your fins you don't get too far,Disney
Legs are required for jumping dancing,Disney
Strolling along down a,Disney
What's that word again? Street Up where they walk,Disney
Up where they run,Disney
Up where they stay all day in the sun,Disney
Wandering free,Disney
Wish I could be,Disney
Part of that world What would I give,Disney
If I could live,Disney
Out of these waters?,Disney
What would I pay,Disney
To spend a day,Disney
Warm on the sand?,Disney
Betcha on land,Disney
They understand,Disney
That they don't reprimand their daughters,Disney
Bright young women,Disney
Sick of swimming,Disney
Ready to stand And I'm ready to know what the people know,Disney
Ask 'em my questions,Disney
And get some answers,Disney
What's a fire and why does it,Disney
What's the word? Burn? When's it my turn?,Disney
Wouldn't I love,Disney
Love to explore that shore above?,Disney
Out of the sea,Disney
Wish I could be,Disney
Part of that world,Disney
Out of the sea,Disney
Wish I could be,Disney
Part of your world You think I'm an ignorant savage,Disney
And you've been so many places,Disney
I guess it must be so,Disney
But still I cannot see,Disney
If the savage one is me,Disney
How can there be so much that you don't know,Disney
You don't know You think you own whatever land you land on,Disney
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim,Disney
But I know every rock and tree and creature,Disney
Has a life has a spirit has a name You think the only people who are people,Disney
Are the people who look and think like you,Disney
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger,Disney
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon,Disney
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned,Disney
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountains,Disney
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind,Disney
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest,Disney
Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth,Disney
Come roll in all the riches all around you,Disney
And for once never wonder what they're worth The rainstorm and the river are my brothers,Disney
The heron and the otter are my friends,Disney
And we are all connected to each other,Disney
In a circle in a hoop that never ends How high will the sycamore grow,Disney
If you cut it down then you'll never know,Disney
And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon,Disney
For whether we are white or copper skinned,Disney
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountains,Disney
We need to paint with all the colors of the wind You can own the Earth and still,Disney
All you'll own is Earth until,Disney
You can paint with all the colors of the wind It's a small world it's a small world,Disney
It's a small world it's a small world It's a world of laughter a world of tears,Disney
It's a world of hope and a world of fears,Disney
There's so much that we share that it's time we're aware,Disney
And a smile means friendship to everyone,Disney
Though the mountains be wide and the oceans are wide,Disney
Come on everybody let's bounce to this,Disney
Let's play some love with a little twist,Disney
It's a small world it's a small world It's a world of laughter a world of tears,Disney
It's a world of hope and a world of fears,Disney
There's so much that we share that it's time we're aware,Disney
It's a small world after all,Disney
It's a small world after all it's a small small small small world,Disney
It's a small world after all it's a small world after all,Disney
It's a small world after all it's a small small small small world A dream is a wish your heart makes,Disney
When you're fast asleep,Disney
In dreams you will loose your heartache,Disney
Whatever you wish for you keep Have faith in your dreams and someday,Disney
Your rainbow will come smiling through,Disney
No matter how your heart is grieving,Disney
If you keep on believing,Disney
The dream that you wish will come true Oh that clock!,Disney
Oh killjoy,Disney
I hear you come on get up you say,Disney
Time to start another day,Disney
Even he orders me around,Disney
Well there's one thing,Disney
They can't order me to stop dreaming,Disney
And perhaps someday,Disney
The dreams that I wish will come true No matter how your heart is grieving,Disney
If you keep on believing,Disney
The dream that you wish will come true I've been staring at the edge of the water,Disney
Long as I can remember,Disney
Never really knowing why,Disney
I wish I could be the perfect daughter,Disney
But I come back to the water,Disney
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take,Disney
Every trail I track,Disney
Every path I make,Disney
Every road leads back to the place I know,Disney
Where I cannot go,Disney
Where I long to be See the line where the sky meets the sea,Disney
It calls me,Disney
And no one knows how far it goes,Disney
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me,Disney
One day I'll know,Disney
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island,Disney
Seems so happy on this island,Disney
Everything is by design,Disney
I know everybody on this island,Disney
Has a role on this island,Disney
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride,Disney
I can make us strong,Disney
I'll be satisfied if I play along,Disney
But the voice inside sings a different song,Disney
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea,Disney
It's blinding,Disney
But no one knows how deep it goes,Disney
And it seems like it's calling out to me,Disney
So come find me,Disney
And let me know,Disney
What's beyond that line,Disney
Will I cross that line The line where the sky meets the sea,Disney
It calls me,Disney
And no one knows how far it goes,Disney
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me,Disney
One day I'll know,Disney
How far I'll go Look at me,Disney
I will never pass for a perfect bride,Disney
Or a perfect daughter,Disney
Can it be,Disney
I'm not meant to play this part?,Disney
Now I see,Disney
That if I were truly to be myself,Disney
I would break my fam'ly's heart Who is that girl I see,Disney
Staring straight,Disney
Back at me?,Disney
Why is my reflection someone,Disney
I don't know?,Disney
Somehow I cannot hide,Disney
Who I am,Disney
Though I've tried,Disney
When will my reflection show,Disney
Who I am inside?,Disney
When will my reflection show,Disney
Who I am inside? When you wish upon a star,Disney
Makes no difference who you are,Disney
Anything your heart desires,Disney
Will come to you,Disney
If your heart is in your dream,Disney
No request is too extreme,Disney
When you wish upon a star,Disney
As dreamers do,Disney
Fate is kind,Disney
She brings to those to love,Disney
The sweet fulfillment of,Disney
Their secret longing,Disney
Like a bolt out of the blue,Disney
Fate steps in and sees you through,Disney
When you wish upon a star,Disney
Your dreams come true Belle,Disney
There's something sweet and almost kind,Disney
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined,Disney
And now he's dear and so unsure,Disney
I wonder why I didn't see it there before Beast,Disney
She glanced this way I thought I saw,Disney
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw,Disney
No it can't be I'll just ignore,Disney
But then she's never looked at me that way before Belle,Disney
New and a bit alarming,Disney
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?,Disney
True that he's no Prince Charming,Disney
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see Lumiere,Disney
Well who'd have thought? Mrs Potts,Disney
Well bless my soul Cogsworth,Disney
Well who'd have known? Mrs Potts,Disney
Well who indeed? Lumiere,Disney
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own? Mrs Potts,Disney
It's so peculiar,Disney
Wait and see. All three,Disney
We'll wait and see,Disney
A few days more,Disney
There may be something there that wasn't there before Cogsworth,Disney
Well here's a thought perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before Chip,Disney
What mama? Mrs Potts,Disney
There may be something there that wasn't there before If there's a prize for rotten judgment,Disney
I guess I've already won that,Disney
No man is worth the aggravation,Disney
That's ancient history been there done that,Disney
Who d'you think you're kidding,Disney
He's the earth and heaven to you,Disney
Try to keep it hidden,Disney
Girl you can't conceal it,Disney
We know how you're feeling,Disney
Who you thinking of?,Disney
No chance no way I won't say it no no,Disney
You swoon you sigh why deny it oh oh,Disney
It's too clich� I won't say I'm in love,Disney
I thought my heart had learned its lesson,Disney
It feels so good when you start out,Disney
My head is screaming get a grip girl,Disney
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out,Disney
Girl you can't deny it,Disney
Who you are and how you're feeling,Disney
Baby we're not buying,Disney
Hon we saw you hit the ceiling,Disney
When you gonna own up that you got got got it bad?,Disney
No chance no way I won't say it no no,Disney
Give up give in check the grin you're in love,Disney
This scene won't play I won't say I'm in love,Disney
We'll do it until you admit you're in love,Disney
You're way off base I won't say it,Disney
Get off my case I won't say it,Disney
Girl don't be proud it's okay you're in love,Disney
At least out loud I won't say I'm in love Tale as old as time,Disney
True as it can be,Disney

I know a girl from an island,Disney
She stands apart from the crowd,Disney
She loves the sea and her people,Disney
She makes her whole family proud,Disney
Sometimes the world seems against you,Disney
The journey may leave a scar,Disney
But scars can heal and reveal just,Disney
Where you are The people you love will change you,Disney
The things you have learned will guide you,Disney
And nothing on earth can silence,Disney
The quiet voice still inside you,Disney
And when that voice starts to whisper,Disney
Moana you've come so far,Disney
Moana listen,Disney
Do you know who you are? ,Disney
Who am I?,Disney
I am a girl who loves my island,Disney
I'm the girl who loves the sea,Disney
It calls me,Disney
I am the daughter of the village chief,Disney
We are descended from voyagers,Disney
Who found their way across the world,Disney
They call me,Disney
I've delivered us to where we are,Disney
I have journeyed farther,Disney
I am everything I've learned and more,Disney
Still it calls me,Disney
And the call isn't out there at all it's inside me,Disney
It's like the tide; always falling and rising,Disney
I will carry you here in my heart you'll remind me,Disney
That come what may,Disney
I know the way,Disney
I am Moana! The only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself,Disney
Can you do that? My dear sweet child that's what I do,Disney
It's what I live for,Disney
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself,Disney
Poor souls with no one else to turn to I admit that in the past I've been a nasty,Disney
They weren't kidding when they called me well a witch,Disney
But you'll find that nowadays,Disney
I've mended all my ways,Disney
Repented seen the light and made a switch,Disney
To this,Disney
And I fortunately know a little magic,Disney
It's a talent that I always have possessed,Disney
And dear lady please don't laugh,Disney
I use it on behalf,Disney
In pain in need,Disney
This one longing to be thinner,Disney
That one wants to get the girl,Disney
And do I help them?,Disney
Yes indeed,Disney
Those poor unfortunate souls,Disney
So sad so true,Disney
They come flocking to my cauldron,Disney
Crying Spells Ursula please!,Disney
And I help them,Disney
Yes I do Now it's happened once or twice,Disney
Someone couldn't pay the price,Disney
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals,Disney
Yes I've had the odd complaint,Disney
But on the whole I've been a saint,Disney
To those poor unfortunate souls Have we got a deal?,Disney
If I become human I'll never be with my father or sisters again,Disney
But you'll have your man,Disney
Life's full of tough choices isn't it?,Disney
Oh and there is one more thing,Disney
We haven't discussed the subject of payment,Disney
I'm not asking much just a token really a trifle,Disney
What I want from you is your voice,Disney
You'll have your looks your pretty face,Disney
And don't underestimate the importance of body language ha! The men up there don't like a lot of blabber,Disney
They think a girl who gossips is a bore,Disney
Yet on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word,Disney
And after all dear what is idle babble for?,Disney
Come on they're not all that impressed with conversation,Disney
True gentlemen avoid it when they can,Disney
But they dote and swoon and fawn,Disney
On a lady who's withdrawn,Disney
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man Come on you poor unfortunate soul,Disney
Go ahead,Disney
Make your choice,Disney
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day,Disney
It won't cost much,Disney
Just your voice!,Disney
You poor unfortunate soul,Disney
It's sad but true,Disney
You've got the pay the toll,Disney
Take a gulp and take a breath,Disney
And go ahead and sign the scroll,Disney
Flotsam Jetsam now I've got her boys,Disney
The boss is on a roll,Disney
This poor unfortunate soul Beluga sevruga,Disney
Come winds of the Caspian Sea,Disney
Larengix glaucitis,Disney
Et max laryngitis,Disney
La voce to me Now sing,Disney
Keep singing!,Disney
Ain't got time for messing around,Disney
And it's not my style This old town can slow you down,Disney
People taking the easy way,Disney
But I know exactly where I'm going,Disney
I'm getting closer and closer everyday And I'm almost there,Disney

People 'round here think I'm crazy,Disney
But I don't care Trials and tribulations,Disney

But there ain't nothing gonna stop me now,Disney
Cause I'm almost there I remember daddy told me,Disney

I've watched a happy pair of lovers walking in the night,Disney
They had a kind of glow around them,Disney
It almost looked like heaven's light I knew I'd never know that warm and loving glow,Disney
Though I might wish with all my might,Disney
No face as hideous as my face,Disney
Was ever meant for heaven's light But suddenly an angel has smiled at me,Disney
And kissed my cheek without a trace of fright I dare to dream that she might even care for me,Disney
And as I ring these bells tonight,Disney
My cold dark tower seems so bright,Disney
I swear it must be Heaven's light Confiteor deo omnipotenti,Disney
Beatae Mariae semper virgini,Disney
Beato Michaeli archangelo,Disney
Sanctis apostolis omnibus sanctis,Disney
Of my virtue I am justly proud,Disney

And let her taste the fires of hell,Disney
Or else let her be mine and mine alone Minister Frollo the gypsy has escaped,Disney
What? No longer in the cathedral she's gone,Disney
But how? Never mind get out you idiot,Disney

To the bells of Notre Dame,Disney
The fisherman fishes the bakerman bakes,Disney
To the bells of Notre Dame,Disney
To the big bells as loud as the thunder,Disney
To the little bells soft as a psalm,Disney
And some say the soul of the city is,Disney
The toll of the bells,Disney
The bells of Notre Dame Dark was the night when our tale was begun,Disney
On the docks near Notre Dame Four frightened gypsies slid silently under,Disney
The docks near Notre Dame But a trap had been laid for the gypsies,Disney
And they gazed up in fear and alarm,Disney
At a figure whose clutches,Disney
Judge Claude Frollo longed,Disney
To purge the world,Disney
Of vice and sin,Disney
And he saw corruption,Disney
Ev'rywhere,Disney
Except within Dies irae dies illa,Disney
Dies irae dies illa,Disney
Solvet saeclum in favilla,Disney
Teste David cum sibylla,Disney
Quantus tremor est futurus,Disney
Quando Judex est venturus See there the innocent blood you have spilt,Disney
On the steps of Notre Dame Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt,Disney
On the steps of Notre Dame You can lie to yourself and your minions,Disney
You can claim that you haven't a qualm,Disney
But you never can run from,Disney
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes,Disney
And for one time in his live,Disney
Of power and control,Disney
Frollo felt a twinge of fear,Disney
For his immortal soul Just so he's kept locked away,Disney
Where no one else can see Even this foul creature may,Disney
Yet prove one day to be,Disney
Of use to me Now here is a riddle to guess if you can,Disney
Sing the bells of Notre Dame,Disney
Who is the monster and who is the man Sing the bells bells bells bells,Disney
Bells bells bells bells,Disney
Bells of Notre Dame I can show you the world,Disney
Shining shimmering splendid,Disney
Tell me princess now when did,Disney
You last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes,Disney
Take you wonder by wonder,Disney
Over sideways and under,Disney
On a magic carpet ride A whole new world,Disney
A new fantastic point of view,Disney
No one to tell us no or where to go,Disney
Or say we're only dreaming A whole new world,Disney
A dazzling place I never knew,Disney
But when I'm way up here it's crystal clear,Disney
That now I'm in a whole new world with you,Disney
Now I'm in a whole new world with you Unbelievable sights,Disney
Indescribable feeling,Disney
Soaring tumbling freewheeling,Disney
Through an endless diamond sky A whole new world,Disney
Don't you dare close your eyes,Disney
A hundred thousand things to see,Disney
I've come so far,Disney
I can't go back,Disney
To where I used to be A whole new world,Disney
Every turn a surprise,Disney
With new horizons to pursue,Disney
There's time to spare,Disney
Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world,Disney
That's where we'll be,Disney
A thrilling chase,Disney
A wondrous place,Disney
For you and me Somewhere out there,Disney
Beneath the pale moonlight,Disney
Someone's thinking of me,Disney
And loving me tonight. Somewhere out there,Disney
Someone's saying a prayer,Disney
That we'll find one another,Disney
In that big somewhere out there. And even though I know how very far apart we are,Disney
It helps to think we might be wishing on the same bright star,Disney
And when the night wind starts to sing a lonesome lullaby,Disney
It helps to think we're sleeping underneath the same big sky! Somewhere out there,Disney
If love can see us through,Disney
Then we'll be together,Disney
Somewhere out there,Disney
Out where dreams,Disney
Come true... There you see her,Disney

Herc was on a roll,Disney
Undefeated,Disney
Riding high,Disney
And the nicest guy,Disney
Not conceited He was a nothin',Disney
A zero zero,Disney
He's our hero,Disney
He hit the heights at breakneck speed! From zero to hero,Disney
Herc is a hero,Disney
Now he's a hero Yes indeed! Tale as old as time,Disney
True as it can be,Disney
Barely even friends,Disney
Then somebody bends,Disney
Unexpectedly. Just a little change,Disney
Small to say the least,Disney
Both a little scared,Disney
Neither one prepared,Disney
Beauty and the Beast Ever just the same,Disney
Ever a surprise,Disney
Ever as before,Disney
Ever just as sure,Disney
As the sun will rise Tale as old as time,Disney
Tune as old as song,Disney
Bittersweet and strange,Disney
Finding you can change,Disney
Learning you were wrong Certain as the sun,Disney
Rising in the east,Disney
Tale as old as time,Disney
Song as old as rhyme,Disney
Beauty and the Beast Tale as old as time,Disney
Song as old as rhyme,Disney
Beauty and the Beast Think of a wonderful thought,Disney
Any merry little thought,Disney
Think of Christmas think of snow,Disney
Think of sleigh bells off you go,Disney
Like reindeer in the sky You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly Think of the happiest things,Disney
It's the same as having wings,Disney
Take the path that moonbeams make,Disney
If the moon is still awake,Disney
You'll see him wink his eye You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly Up you go with a height and ho,Disney
To the stars beyond the blue,Disney
There's a Never Land waiting for you,Disney
Where all your happy dreams come true,Disney
Every dream that you dream will come true When there's a smile in your heart,Disney
There's no better time to start,Disney
Think of all the joy you'll find,Disney
When you leave the world behind,Disney
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly When there's a smile in your heart,Disney
There's no better time to start,Disney
Think of all the joy you'll find,Disney
When you leave the world behind,Disney
And bid your cares goodbye You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly,Disney
You can fly I've been standing at the edge of the water,Disney
Long as I can remember,Disney
Never really knowing why,Disney
I wish I could be the perfect daughter,Disney
But I come back to the water,Disney
No matter how hard I try Every turn I take,Disney
Every trail I track,Disney
Every path I make,Disney
Every road leads back to the place I know,Disney
Where I cannot go,Disney
Where I long to be See the light where the sky meets the sea,Disney
It calls me,Disney
No one knows how far it goes,Disney
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me,Disney
One day I'll know,Disney
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go I know everybody on this island,Disney
Seems so happy on this island,Disney
Everything is by design,Disney
I know everybody on this island,Disney
Has a role on this island,Disney
So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride,Disney
I can make us strong,Disney
I'll be satisfied if I play along,Disney
But the voice inside sings a different song,Disney
What is wrong with me See the light as it shines on the sea,Disney
It's blinding,Disney
But no one knows how deep it goes,Disney
And it seems like it's calling out to me,Disney
So come find me,Disney
And let me know,Disney
What's beyond that line,Disney
Will I cross that line See the light where the sky meets the sea,Disney
It calls me,Disney
And no one knows how far it goes,Disney
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me,Disney
One day I'll know,Disney
How far I'll go Well Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam,Disney
I was a drab little crab once,Disney
Now I know I can be happy as a clam,Disney
Because I'm beautiful baby Did your granny say listen to your heart?,Disney
Be who you are on the inside?,Disney
I need three words to tear her argument apart your granny lied I'd rather be shiny,Disney
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck,Disney
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny,Disney
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck,Disney
Just a sec don't ya know,Disney
Fish are dumb dumb dumb,Disney
They chase anything that glitters beginners,Disney
Oh and here they come come come to the brightest thing that glitters,Disney
Mmm fish dinners,Disney
Little Maui's havin' trouble with his look,Disney
You little semi demi mini god,Disney
Ouch what a terrible performance get the hook,Disney
Get it?,Disney
You don't swing it like you used to man,Disney
Yet I have to give you credit from my start,Disney
And your tattoos on the outside,Disney
For just like you I made myself a work of art,Disney
I'll never hide,Disney
I can't I'm too shiny,Disney
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough,Disney
Strut my stuff my stuff is so shiny,Disney
Send your armies but they'll never be enough,Disney
My shell's too tough Maui man,Disney
You can try try try but you can't expect a demigod to beat a decapod,Disney
Look it up,Disney
You will die die die now it's time for me to take apart your achin' heart Far from the ones who abandoned you,Disney
Chasin' the love of the humans who made you feel wanted,Disney
You tried to be tough but your armor's just not hard enough,Disney
Maui now it's time to kick your heiney,Disney
Ever seen someone so shiny Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see,Disney
C'est la vie mon ami,Disney
I'm so shiny,Disney
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea just for me,Disney
You'll never be quite as shiny,Disney
You wish you were nice and shiny What I love most about rivers is,Disney
You can't step in the same river twice,Disney
The water's always changing always flowing But people I guess can't live like that,Disney
We all must pay a price,Disney
To be safe we lose our chance of ever knowing What's around the river bend,Disney
Waiting just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend,Disney
Beyond the shore where the gulls fly free,Disney
Don't know what for what I dream the day might send,Disney
Just around the river bend for me coming for me I feel it there beyond those trees,Disney
Or right behind these waterfalls,Disney
Can I ignore that sound of distant drumming? For a handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls,Disney
And never dreams that something might be coming? Just around the river bend,Disney
Just around the river bend I look once more just around the river bend,Disney
Beyond the shore somewhere past the sea,Disney
Don't know what for why do all my dreams extend,Disney
Just around the river bend just around the river bend Should I choose the smoothest course,Disney
Steady as the beating drum? Should I marry Kocoum?,Disney
Is all my dreaming at an end?,Disney
Or do you still wait for me dream giver,Disney
Just around the river bend? In every job that must be done,Disney
There is an element of fun,Disney
You find the fun and snap!,Disney
The job's a game And every task you undertake,Disney
Becomes a piece of cake,Disney
A lark! A spree! It's very clear to see that A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,Disney
The medicine go down the medicine go down,Disney
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,Disney
In a most delightful way A robin feathering his nest has very little time to rest,Disney
While gathering his bits of twine and twig,Disney
Though quite intent in his pursuit,Disney
He has a merry tune to toot,Disney
He knows a song will move the job along For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,Disney
The medicine go down the medicine go down,Disney
Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down,Disney
In a most delightful way The honey bee that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb,Disney
Never tired of ever buzzing to and fro,Disney
Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip,Disney
Their task is not a grind Ah ah ah! Ma chere Mademoiselle it is with deepest pride,Disney

I was there to dry her tears,Disney
And when she was happy so was I,Disney
When she loved me Through the summer and the fall,Disney
We had each other that was all,Disney
Just she and I together,Disney
Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely,Disney
I was there to comfort her,Disney
And I knew that she loved me So the years went by,Disney
I stayed the same,Disney
She began to drift away,Disney
I was left alone Still I waited for the day,Disney
When she'd say,Disney
I will always love you Lonely and forgotten,Disney
Never thought she'd look my way,Disney
She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do,Disney
Like she loved me,Disney
When she loved me When somebody loved me,Disney
Everything was beautiful,Disney
Every hour we spent together,Disney
Lives within my heart When she loved me hey All those days watching from the windows,Disney
All those years outside looking in,Disney
All that time never even knowing,Disney
Just how blind I've been,Disney
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight,Disney
Now I'm here suddenly I see,Disney
Standing here it's all so clear,Disney
I'm where I'm meant to be And at last I see the light,Disney
And it's like the fog has lifted,Disney
And at last I see the light,Disney
And it's like the sky is new,Disney
And it's warm and real and bright,Disney
And the world has somehow shifted,Disney
All at once everything looks different,Disney
Now that I see you All those days chasing down a daydream,Disney
All those years living in a blur,Disney
All that time never truly seeing,Disney
Things the way they were,Disney
Now she's here shining in the starlight,Disney
Now she's here suddenly I know,Disney
If she's here it's crystal clear,Disney
I'm where I'm meant to go And at last I see the light And it's like the fog has lifted And at last I see the light And it's like the sky is new And it's warm and real and bright,Disney
And the world has somehow shifted,Disney
All at once everything is different,Disney

Can it be,Disney
I'm not meant to play this part?,Disney
Now I see that if I were truly to be myself,Disney
I would break my family's heart. Who is that girl I see staring straight back at me?,Disney
Why is my reflection someone I don't know?,Disney
Somehow I cannot hide,Disney
Who I am though I've tried.,Disney
When will my reflection show who I am inside?,Disney
How I pray that a time will come,Disney
I can free myself from their expectations,Disney
On that day I'll discover someway to be myself and to make my family proud.,Disney
They want a docile lamb,Disney
Must there be a secret me,Disney
I'm forced to hide?,Disney
Must I pretend that I am someone else for all time?,Disney
When will my reflection show who I am inside?,Disney
When will my reflection show who I am inside? I know you,Disney
I walked with you,Disney
Once Upon a dream,Disney
I know you That gleam in your eyes,Disney

Yet I know it's true,Disney
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you,Disney
I know what you do,Disney
You'll love me at once,Disney
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah,Disney
But if I know you,Disney

But if I know you,Disney
I know what you do,Disney
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream There's a calm surrender to the rush of day,Disney
When the heat of the rolling world can be turned away,Disney
An enchanted moment and it sees me through,Disney
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you And can you feel the love tonight? It is where we are,Disney
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest,Disney
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best There's a time for everyone if they only learn,Disney
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn,Disney
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors,Disney
And can you feel the love tonight? How it's laid to rest,Disney
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best,Disney

I'll agree are three jolly good sports,Disney
But cream of the crop tip of the top,Disney
It's Mary Poppins and there we stop! If I never knew you,Disney
If I never felt this love,Disney
I would have no inkling of,Disney
How precious life can be And if I never knew you,Disney
I would never have a clue,Disney
How at last I'd find in you,Disney
The missing part of me In this world so full of fear,Disney
Full of rage and lies,Disney
I can see the truth so clear,Disney
In your eyes,Disney
So dry your eyes And I'm so grateful to you,Disney
I'd have lived my whole life through,Disney
Lost forever,Disney
If I never knew you If I never knew you,Disney
I'd be safe but half as real,Disney
Never knowing I could feel,Disney
A love so strong and true I'm so grateful to you,Disney
I'd have lived my whole life through,Disney
Lost forever,Disney
If I never knew you I thought our love would be so beautiful Somehow we made the whole world bright I never knew that fear and hate could be so strong,Disney
All they'd leave us were these whispers in the night,Disney
But still my heart is singing,Disney
We were right If I never knew you,Disney
There's no moment I regret,Disney
If I never knew this love,Disney
I would have no inkling of,Disney
If our time has gone too fast I've lived at last,Disney
How precious life can be I thought our love would be so beautiful,Disney
Somehow we'd make the whole world bright I thought our love would be so beautiful,Disney
We'd turn the darkness into light And still my heart is singing,Disney
We were right We were right,Disney
And if I never knew you,Disney
I'd have lived my whole life through Empty as the sky Never knowing why,Disney
Lost forever I know you,Disney
I walked with you,Disney
Once Upon a dream,Disney
I know you That gleam in your eyes,Disney
Is so familiar a gleam,Disney
Yet I know it's true,Disney
That visions are seldom what they seem But if I know you,Disney
I know what you do,Disney
You'll love me at once,Disney
The way you did once upon a dream La da la da la ahahahahah,Disney
But if I know you,Disney
I know what you do,Disney
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream,Disney
I know you,Disney
I walked with you,Disney
Once Upon a dream I know you,Disney
That gleam in your eyes,Disney
Is so familiar a gleam,Disney
Yet I know it's true That visions are seldom what they seem,Disney
But if I know you,Disney
I know what you do,Disney
You'll love me at once The way you did once upon a dream You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
When the road looks rough ahead,Disney
And you're miles and miles,Disney
From your nice warm bed,Disney
Just remember what your old pal said,Disney
Boy you've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got troubles well I've got 'em too,Disney
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you,Disney
We stick together and we see it through,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me Some other folks might be,Disney
A little bit smarter than I am,Disney
Bigger and stronger too,Disney
Maybe,Disney
But none of them will ever love you the way I do,Disney
It's me and you,Disney
And as the years go by,Disney
Boys our friendship will never die,Disney
You're gonna see,Disney
It's our destiny,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me,Disney
You've got a friend in me I have often dreamed of a far off place,Disney
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me,Disney
Where the crowds would cheer when they see my face,Disney
And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be I'll be there someday I can go the distance,Disney
I will find my way if I can be strong,Disney
I know every mile would be worth my while,Disney
When I go the distance I'll be right where I belong Down an unknown road to embrace my fate,Disney
Though that road may wander it will lead me to you,Disney
And a thousand years would be worth the wait,Disney
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through And I won't look back I can go the distance,Disney
And I'll stay on track no I won't accept defeat,Disney
It's an uphill slope,Disney
But I won't loose hope 'till I go the distance,Disney
And my journey is complete oh yeah But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part,Disney
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart oh Like a shooting star I will go the distance,Disney
I will search the world I will face its harms,Disney
I don't care how far I can go the distance,Disney
Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I will search the world I will face its harms,Disney
'Till I find my hero's welcome waiting in your arms I've got no strings,Disney
To hold me down,Disney
To make me fret,Disney
Or make me frown,Disney
I had strings,Disney
But now I'm free,Disney
That's the only way to go,Disney
I want the world to know,Disney
Nothing ever worries me I've got no strings,Disney
So I have fun,Disney
I'm not tied up to anyone,Disney
They've got strings,Disney
But you can see,Disney
There are no strings on me You have no strings,Disney
Your arms is free,Disney
To love me by the Zuider Zee,Disney
Ya ya ya,Disney
If you would woo,Disney
I'd bust my strings for you You've got no strings,Disney
Comme ci comme ca,Disney
I've got strings,Disney
But entre nous,Disney
I'd cut my strings for you Down where the Volga flows,Disney
There's a Russian rendezvous,Disney
Where me and Ivan go,Disney
But I'd rather go with you hey There are no strings on me Come stop your crying,Disney
It will be alright,Disney
Just take my hand,Disney
And hold it tight I will protect you,Disney
From all around you,Disney
I will be here,Disney
Don't you cry For one so small,Disney
You seem so strong,Disney
My arms will hold you,Disney
Keep you safe and warm,Disney
This bond between us,Disney
Can't be broken,Disney

They just don't trust what they can't explain,Disney
I know we're different but deep inside us,Disney
We're not that different at all And you'll be in my heart,Disney
Yes you'll be in my heart,Disney
From this day on,Disney
Now and forever more Don't listen to them,Disney
'Cause what do they know,Disney
We need each other to have to hold,Disney
They'll see in time I know When destiny calls you you must be strong,Disney
I may not be with you,Disney
But you got to hold on,Disney
They'll see in time I know,Disney
We'll show them together 'Cause you'll be in my heart,Disney
Believe me you'll be in my heart,Disney

Back to the seasons of my youth,Dolly Parton
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us,Dolly Parton
And how my momma put the rags to use There were rags of many colors and every piece was small,Dolly Parton
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall,Dolly Parton
Momma sewed the rags together sewin' every piece with love,Dolly Parton
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of As she sewed she told a story from the Bible she had read,Dolly Parton
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said,Dolly Parton
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness,Dolly Parton
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss My coat of many colors that my momma made for me,Dolly Parton
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be,Dolly Parton
In my coat of many colors my momma made for me So with patches on my britches holes in both my shoes,Dolly Parton
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school,Dolly Parton
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me,Dolly Parton
and my coat of many colors my momma made for me And oh I couldn't understand that for I thought I was rich,Dolly Parton
And then I told them of the love my momma sewed in every stitch,Dolly Parton
And I told 'em all the story momma told me while she sewed,Dolly Parton
And why my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes They didn't understand it and I tried to make them see,Dolly Parton
One is only poor only if you choose to be It is true we had no money but I was rich as I could be,Dolly Parton
In my coat of many colors momma made for me,Dolly Parton
Made just for me I could hold out my arms say I love you this much,Dolly Parton
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch,Dolly Parton
How much and how far would I go to prove,Dolly Parton
The depth and the breadth of my love for you? From here to the moon and back,Dolly Parton
Who else in this world will love you like that?,Dolly Parton
Love everlasting I promise you that,Dolly Parton
From here to the moon and back,Dolly Parton
From here to the moon and back I want you to know you can always depend,Dolly Parton
On promises made and love without end,Dolly Parton
No need to wonder how faithful I'll be,Dolly Parton
Now and on into eternity From here to the moon and back,Dolly Parton
Who else in this world will love you like that?,Dolly Parton
Forever and always I'll be where you're at,Dolly Parton
From here to the moon and back,Dolly Parton
From here to the moon and back I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat,Dolly Parton
I would call out your name to echo through the vast,Dolly Parton
Thank heaven for you and to God tip my hat,Dolly Parton
From here to the moon and back,Dolly Parton
And I'll spend forever just proving that fact,Dolly Parton
From here to the moon and back From here to the moon and back... Love is like a butterfly,Dolly Parton

And in it lived a man I'd never seen,Dolly Parton
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man,Dolly Parton
And you better not set foot on his land,Dolly Parton

It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried,Dolly Parton
To hold out just for you?,Dolly Parton
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life,Dolly Parton
Turned my dreams around,Dolly Parton
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late,Dolly Parton
You say you want me and it's too late,Dolly Parton
Once my love for you was so great,Dolly Parton
But it's too late to love me now,Dolly Parton
It's too late to love me now Don't you know how hard I tried,Dolly Parton
To hold out just for you?,Dolly Parton
Lovin' you from mem'ry day by day Then someone came into my life,Dolly Parton
Turned my world around,Dolly Parton
He's takin' all the love you threw away It's too late,Dolly Parton
You say you need me and it's too late,Dolly Parton
Once my love for you was so great,Dolly Parton
But it's too late to love me now,Dolly Parton
It's too late to love me now Two little children a boy and a girl,Dolly Parton
Sat by an old church door,Dolly Parton
The little girl's feet,Dolly Parton
Were as brown as the curl,Dolly Parton
That fell on the dress that she wore,Dolly Parton
The little boy's cloths were all tattered and torn,Dolly Parton
They shown beneath his blue eyes Why don't you go home,Dolly Parton
To you mommy I said,Dolly Parton
And this was the maddens reply,Dolly Parton
Mommy's in heaven,Dolly Parton
Angels took her away,Dolly Parton
Left Tim and I all alone,Dolly Parton
We've no one to love us,Dolly Parton
And daddy is dead,Dolly Parton
And our darling mother is gone Mommy got sick,Dolly Parton
Angels took her away,Dolly Parton
To dwell in those mansions so bright,Dolly Parton
She said she would come,Dolly Parton
For her children some day,Dolly Parton
And I guess she's coming tonight,Dolly Parton
The sexton came early,Dolly Parton
To ring the church bell,Dolly Parton
And found them,Dolly Parton
Beneath the snow white,Dolly Parton
The angels made room for the orphans to dwell,Dolly Parton
She has seen and done it all,Dolly Parton
She's a woman she know how to,Dolly Parton
Dish it out or take it all,Dolly Parton
Her heart's as soft as feathers,Dolly Parton
Still she weathers stormy skies,Dolly Parton
And she's a sparrow when she's broken,Dolly Parton
But she's an eagle when she flies A kaleidoscope of colors,Dolly Parton
You can toss her around and round,Dolly Parton
You can keep her in you vision,Dolly Parton
But you'll never keep her down,Dolly Parton
She's a lover she's a mother,Dolly Parton
She's a friend and she's a wife,Dolly Parton
And she's a sparrow when she's broken,Dolly Parton
But she's an eagle when she flies Gentle as the sweet magnolia,Dolly Parton
Strong as steel her faith and pride,Dolly Parton
She's an everlasting shoulder,Dolly Parton
She's the leaning post of life,Dolly Parton
She hurts deep and when she weeps,Dolly Parton
She's just as fragile as a child,Dolly Parton
And she's a sparrow when she's broken,Dolly Parton
But she's an eagle when she flies She's a sparrow when she's broken,Dolly Parton
But she's an eagle when she flies,Dolly Parton
Oh bless her Lord,Dolly Parton
She's an eagle when she flies I can see you're disappointed,Dolly Parton
By the way you look at me,Dolly Parton
And I'm sorry that I'm not,Dolly Parton
The woman you thought I'd be,Dolly Parton
Yes I've made my mistakes,Dolly Parton
But listen and understand,Dolly Parton
My mistakes are no worse than yours,Dolly Parton
Just because I'm a woman So when you look at me,Dolly Parton
Don't feel sorry for yourself,Dolly Parton
Just think of all the shame,Dolly Parton
You might have brought somebody else Just let me tell you this,Dolly Parton
Then we'll both know where we stand,Dolly Parton
My mistakes are no worse than yours,Dolly Parton
Just because I'm a woman Now a man will take a good girl,Dolly Parton
And he'll ruin her reputation,Dolly Parton
But when he wants to marry,Dolly Parton
Well that's a different situation He'll just walk off and leave her,Dolly Parton
To do the best she can,Dolly Parton
While he looks for an angel,Dolly Parton
To wear his wedding band Now I know that I'm no angel,Dolly Parton
If that's what you thought you'd found,Dolly Parton
I was just the victim of,Dolly Parton
A man that let me down Yes I've made my mistakes,Dolly Parton
But listen and understand,Dolly Parton
My mistakes are no worse than yours,Dolly Parton
Just because I'm a woman No my mistakes are no worse than yours,Dolly Parton
Just because I'm a woman There's a picture that I carry,Dolly Parton
One we made some time ago,Dolly Parton
When they ask who's in the picture with me,Dolly Parton
I say just Someone I use to know Just someone I used to spend some time with,Dolly Parton
Just a flame that's lost its glow,Dolly Parton
But I don't them of the nights I cried without you,Dolly Parton
I say just Someone I use to know Just someone I use to run around with,Dolly Parton
Just a friend from long ago,Dolly Parton
I don't tell them how lost I am without you,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy,Dolly Parton
She never wanted to be more than mother and a wife,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy The only things that seemed to be important in her life,Dolly Parton
Was to make our house a home and make us happy,Dolly Parton
Momma never wanted anymore than what she had,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy He often left her all alone,Dolly Parton
She didn't mind the stayin' home,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy,Dolly Parton
And she never missed the flowers,Dolly Parton
And the gifts he never gave her,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy Being took for granted was a thing that she accepted,Dolly Parton
And she didn't need those things to make her happy,Dolly Parton
She didn't even seem to notice,Dolly Parton
That he didn't kiss and hold her,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy One morning we awoke,Dolly Parton
Just to find the note,Dolly Parton
That momma carefully wrote,Dolly Parton
And left to daddy,Dolly Parton
And as he began to read it,Dolly Parton
Our ears could not believe it,Dolly Parton
The words that she had written there to daddy She said our kids are old enough,Dolly Parton
And they don't need me very much,Dolly Parton
So I've gone in search for love I need so badly,Dolly Parton
I have needed you so long,Dolly Parton
But I just can't keep holdin' on,Dolly Parton
She never meant to come back home,Dolly Parton
If she did she never did say so to daddy Momma's gone,Dolly Parton
Good-bye to daddy Life has dealt us our fair share of pain along the way,Dolly Parton
And many dreams have withered on the vine,Dolly Parton
But dreams are all such fleeting things and happiness is now,Dolly Parton
We'll just live our lives one day at a time In all the stormy weather love has always seen us through,Dolly Parton
Happiness is knowing that you're mine,Dolly Parton
Why worry about tomorrow for tomorrow may not come,Dolly Parton
We'll just live our lives one day at a time This one thing I'm learning you take life as it comes,Dolly Parton
Each day is just a gift so don't be blind,Dolly Parton
Tomorrow may bring gladness or a little bit of sadness,Dolly Parton
We'll just live our lives one day at a time,Dolly Parton
,Dolly Parton
We may not have a fortune making plans to change the world,Dolly Parton
We may leave little marks in life's design,Dolly Parton
But as long as we're together every hour is filled with love,Dolly Parton
And we'll just live our lives one day at a time Just one thing I'm learning...,Dolly Parton
We'll just live our lives one day at a time You packed in the morning,Dolly Parton
I stared out the window,Dolly Parton
And I struggled for something to say,Dolly Parton
You left in the rain without closing the door,Dolly Parton
I didn't stand in your way,Dolly Parton
Now I miss you more,Dolly Parton
Than I missed you before,Dolly Parton
And now where I'll find comfort god knows,Dolly Parton
'Cause you left me,Dolly Parton
Just when I needed you most,Dolly Parton
Yes you left me,Dolly Parton
Just when I needed you most,Dolly Parton
Now most every morning,Dolly Parton
I stare out the window,Dolly Parton
I think about where you might be,Dolly Parton
I've written you letters that I'd like to send,Dolly Parton
If you would just send one to me,Dolly Parton
'Cause I need you more,Dolly Parton
Than I needed before,Dolly Parton
And now where I'll find comfort god knows,Dolly Parton
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most,Dolly Parton
Yes you left me,Dolly Parton
Just when I needed you most,Dolly Parton
You packed in the morning I stared out the window,Dolly Parton
And I struggled for something to say,Dolly Parton
You left in the rain without closing the door,Dolly Parton
I didn't stand in your way Now I love you more,Dolly Parton
Than I loved you before,Dolly Parton
And now where I'll find comfort god knows,Dolly Parton
'Cause you left me Just when I needed you most,Dolly Parton
You left me,Dolly Parton
Just when I needed you most,Dolly Parton
Oh you left me Just when I needed you most We're holding on to nothing left to hold onto,Dolly Parton
I'm so tired of holding on to nothin',Dolly Parton
The years have shown no kindness,Dolly Parton
For the hard times we've been through We've squeezed the life from every dream,Dolly Parton
And still go right on bluffin',Dolly Parton
With really nothin' left to hold onto Oh why do we keep holding on,Dolly Parton
With nothing left to hold onto,Dolly Parton
Let's be honest with each other,Dolly Parton
That's the least that we can do,Dolly Parton
I feel guilty when they envy me and you,Dolly Parton
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We were young and foolishly mistaken,Dolly Parton
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied,Dolly Parton
With only tears to show for all the years that we've been fakin',Dolly Parton
God only knows how long how hard we've tried Oh why do we keep holding on,Dolly Parton
With nothing left to hold onto,Dolly Parton
Let's be honest with each other,Dolly Parton
That's the least that we can do,Dolly Parton
I feel guilty when they envy me and you,Dolly Parton
We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto We're holding on with nothing left to hold onto TIE A YELLOW RIBBON ROUND THE OLD OAK TREE,Dolly Parton

For months now he'd been waitin' since he'd gone off to war,Dolly Parton
And his eyes were filled with tears of great relief Welcome home son,Dolly Parton
His loving arms held open and his heart so full of love,Dolly Parton
Welcome home son,Dolly Parton
I've been prayin' and been hopin' and I never did give up,Dolly Parton
I knew that you'd return to me,Dolly Parton
The place where you were meant to be,Dolly Parton
Rest now for you've been gone too long.,Dolly Parton
I hear him say as they embrace,Dolly Parton
And a mother wakes up crying in the night,Dolly Parton
She thought she'd heard him calling in that moment she could tell,Dolly Parton
Her only son had passed into the light Welcome home son,Dolly Parton
His loving arems held open and his heart so full of love,Dolly Parton
Welcome home son,Dolly Parton
As Jesus stood there glowing their hands reached out and touched,Dolly Parton
I knew that you'd return to me,Dolly Parton
The place that you were meant to be,Dolly Parton
Rest now for you've been gone too long,Dolly Parton
As they embraced I heard him say,Dolly Parton

To live and die and then to live again Welcome home son,Dolly Parton
I hear God saying when they nailed Christ to the cross that day,Dolly Parton

When there are no more wars to fight,Dolly Parton
And we're all children of the light,Dolly Parton
When the father and the son say,Dolly Parton
Welcome home! Tag Welcome home welcome home welcome home. You ought to go north somebody told us,Dolly Parton
'Cause the air is filled with gold dust,Dolly Parton
And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands,Dolly Parton
Now I don't recall who said it,Dolly Parton
But we'd spent our lives on credit,Dolly Parton
And so we headed out to find our promised land Just poor Smokey Mountains farm folk,Dolly Parton
With nothing more than high hopes,Dolly Parton
So we hitched our station wagon to a star,Dolly Parton
But our dreams all fell in on us,Dolly Parton
'Cause there was no land of promise,Dolly Parton
Lord it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are Oh and these northern nights are dreary,Dolly Parton
My old southern heart is weary,Dolly Parton
As I wonder how the old folks are back home,Dolly Parton
But I know that they all love me,Dolly Parton
And I know they're thinking of me,Dolly Parton
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong You know I've been thinkin' just a whole lot lately,Dolly Parton
About what's been and what awaits me,Dolly Parton
It takes all I've got to give what life demands,Dolly Parton
Lord you go insane if you give in to it,Dolly Parton
Life's a mill and I've been through it,Dolly Parton
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands Oh and these northern nights they're dreary,Dolly Parton
These old southern eyes are teary,Dolly Parton
As I wonder how the old folks are back home,Dolly Parton
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus,Dolly Parton
I know He'll love and guide and lead us,Dolly Parton
And Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong If I'll keep looking to the Father,Dolly Parton
He'll keep my heads above the water,Dolly Parton
While the Smokey Mountains memories keep me strong,Dolly Parton
My home sweet home I thought I had seen pretty girls in my time,Dolly Parton
But that was before I met you,Dolly Parton
I never saw one that I wanted for mine,Dolly Parton
But that was before I met you,Dolly Parton
I thought I was swinging the world by the tail,Dolly Parton
I thought I could never be blue,Dolly Parton
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved,Dolly Parton
But that was before I met you I thought I'd stay single always be free,Dolly Parton
But that was before I met you,Dolly Parton
I said that no sweet thang could ever hold me,Dolly Parton
But that was before I met you I thought I was swinging the world by the tail,Dolly Parton
I thought I could never be blue,Dolly Parton
I thought I'd been kissed and I thought I'd been loved,Dolly Parton
But that was before I met you That was before I met you An old man was sitting at his table one day,Dolly Parton
Writing a letter to pass time away,Dolly Parton
His little granddaughter climbed up on his knee,Dolly Parton
Saying won't you please write a letter for me,Dolly Parton
Oh what must I say in this letter I pray,Dolly Parton
Tell mommy I miss her since she went away,Dolly Parton
I'm coming to see her real soon I hope,Dolly Parton
He chocked back a big lump that rouse in his throat He sealed it and wrote on that big envelope,Dolly Parton
To god up in heaven you'll get it I hope,Dolly Parton
He stamped it and handed it to her to mail,Dolly Parton
Her big eyes were shining her little face pale,Dolly Parton
She was crossing the street to the box o'er the way,Dolly Parton
And when she stepped out Never looked either way,Dolly Parton
A big object hit her and sped away fast,Dolly Parton
The little girls prayers had been answered at last,Dolly Parton
The postman was passing,Dolly Parton
And picked up the note,Dolly Parton
Addressed to the master,Dolly Parton
And these words he spoke,Dolly Parton
Strait up into heave this letter did go,Dolly Parton
Handing me a yellow rose,Dolly Parton
You asked me out,Dolly Parton
And to your surprise,Dolly Parton
And to mine I said I'd go,Dolly Parton
I thought it so romantic,Dolly Parton
And I found you sweet and bold,Dolly Parton
Though we'd only met,Dolly Parton
I still said yes,Dolly Parton
To a single yellow rose And for years to come,Dolly Parton
You were the one,Dolly Parton
To sleep with me at night,Dolly Parton
To laugh and talk,Dolly Parton
And share my thoughts,Dolly Parton
And hold me when I'd cry,Dolly Parton
And on every occasion,Dolly Parton
And for no good reason to,Dolly Parton
A big bouquet or a single yellow rose,Dolly Parton
Was sent from you Yellow roses,Dolly Parton
The color of sunshine,Dolly Parton
You loved me at one time,Dolly Parton
Why did you have to go,Dolly Parton
Yellow roses,Dolly Parton
Are you sending your new love,Dolly Parton
My bright yellow rose buds,Dolly Parton

With good luck and wishes too,Dolly Parton
Fine as he can be,Dolly Parton

Yeah he's done kiss me on the mouth,Dolly Parton
And he's gonna marry me Yodel-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de The gates and doors were barred,Dolly Parton
And all the windows fastened down,Dolly Parton
I spent the night in sleeplessness,Dolly Parton
And rose at every sound,Dolly Parton
Half in hope of sorrow,Dolly Parton
And half in fear the day,Dolly Parton
Would find the soldiers breakin' through,Dolly Parton
To drag us all away,Dolly Parton
And just before the sunrise,Dolly Parton
I heard something at the wall,Dolly Parton
The gate began to rattle,Dolly Parton
And a voice began to call,Dolly Parton
I hurried to the window,Dolly Parton
Looked down into the street,Dolly Parton
Expecting swords and torches,Dolly Parton
And the sound of soldiers' feet But there was no one there but Mary,Dolly Parton
So I went down to let her in,Dolly Parton
John stood there beside me,Dolly Parton
As she told me where she'd been,Dolly Parton
She said they've moved Him in the night,Dolly Parton
And none of us know where,Dolly Parton
The stone's been rolled away,Dolly Parton
And now His body isn't there We both ran towards the garden,Dolly Parton
Then John ran on ahead,Dolly Parton
We found the stone and empty tomb,Dolly Parton
Just the way that Mary said,Dolly Parton
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in,Dolly Parton
Was just an empty shell,Dolly Parton
And how or where they'd taken Him,Dolly Parton
Was more than I could tell Oh something strange had happened there,Dolly Parton
Just what I did not know,Dolly Parton
John believed a miracle,Dolly Parton
But I just turned to go,Dolly Parton
Circumstance and speculation,Dolly Parton
Couldn't lift me very high,Dolly Parton
'Cause I'd seen them crucify Him,Dolly Parton
Then I saw Him die Back inside the house again,Dolly Parton
The guilt and anguish came,Dolly Parton
Everything I'd promised Him,Dolly Parton
Just added to my shame,Dolly Parton
When at last it came to choices,Dolly Parton
I denied I knew His name,Dolly Parton
And even if He was alive,Dolly Parton
It wouldn't be the same But suddenly the air was filled,Dolly Parton
With a strange and sweet perfume,Dolly Parton
Light that came from everywhere,Dolly Parton
Drove shadows from the room,Dolly Parton
And Jesus stood before me,Dolly Parton
With His arms held open wide,Dolly Parton
And I fell down on my knees,Dolly Parton
And I just clung to Him and cried Then He raised me to my feet,Dolly Parton
And as I looked into His eyes,Dolly Parton
The love was shining out from Him,Dolly Parton
Like sunlight from the skies,Dolly Parton
Guilt in my confusion,Dolly Parton
Disappeared in sweet release,Dolly Parton
And every fear I ever had,Dolly Parton
Just melted into peace He's alive yes He's alive,Dolly Parton
Yes He's alive and I'm forgiven,Dolly Parton
Heaven's gates are open wide,Dolly Parton
He's alive yes He's alive,Dolly Parton
Oh He's alive and I'm forgiven,Dolly Parton
Heaven's gates are open wide,Dolly Parton
He's alive He's alive,Dolly Parton
Hallelujah He's alive,Dolly Parton
He's alive and I'm forgiven,Dolly Parton
Heaven's gates are open wide,Dolly Parton
He's alive He's alive He's alive,Dolly Parton
I believe it He's alive,Dolly Parton
Sweet Jesus New York City ain't no kind of place,Dolly Parton
For a country girl with a friendly face,Dolly Parton
If you smile people look at you funny they take it wrong,Dolly Parton
The greenest state in the land of the free,Dolly Parton
And the home of the Grand Ole Opry,Dolly Parton
Is calling me back to my Smoky Mountain home I wish I had my old fishin' pole,Dolly Parton
And was sitting on the banks of the fishing hole,Dolly Parton
Eating green apples and waiting for the fish to bite,Dolly Parton
Life ain't as simple as it used to be,Dolly Parton
Just since the big apple took a bite out of me,Dolly Parton
And Lord I'm so Tennessee homesick that I could die But I ain't been home in I don't know when,Dolly Parton
If I had it all to do over again,Dolly Parton
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed,Dolly Parton
What I wouldn't give for a little bitty taste,Dolly Parton
Of Mama's homemade chocolate cake,Dolly Parton
Tennessee homesick blues is running through my head Mama you can fluff my feather bed,Dolly Parton
Just as soon as I can I'm gonna head,Dolly Parton
Back to the Tennessee hills and it better be soon,Dolly Parton
Daddy you can load the rifles up,Dolly Parton
We're gonna load them dogs on the pickup truck,Dolly Parton
And head up to Calhoun Country and catch us a coon But I ain't been home in I don't know when,Dolly Parton
If I had it all to do over again,Dolly Parton
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed,Dolly Parton
Eatin' grits and gravy and country ham,Dolly Parton
Go to church on Sunday with dinner on the grounds,Dolly Parton
Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head And I ain't been home in I don't know when,Dolly Parton
If I had it all to do over again,Dolly Parton
Tonight I'd sleep in my old feather bed,Dolly Parton
Good Lord have mercy on a country girl,Dolly Parton
Tryin' to make a living in a rhinestone world,Dolly Parton
It's hard to be a diamond in a rhinestone world,Dolly Parton
With Tennessee homesick blues are runnin' through my head,Dolly Parton
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues runnin' through my head,Dolly Parton
Tennessee homesick blues I remember the time when the bloom was on the cotton,Dolly Parton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings,Dolly Parton
Winter cares which we're already few or soon forgotten,Dolly Parton
Just sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we sit every Sunday and watched the married ladies,Dolly Parton
And we dreamed of white dresses and church bells in the spring,Dolly Parton
And they talked and painted their nails while they let us hold their babies,Dolly Parton
Sittin' on the front porch swing Where was I when the time came to join the married ladies,Dolly Parton
Why did I paint the nail when the finger had no ring,Dolly Parton
Why do I sit at night at my age to hold their baby,Dolly Parton
Sittin' on the front porch swing When the mind longs to follow but the memory erases,Dolly Parton
And the lips form the words that the heart no longer sings,Dolly Parton
When the leaves in the hollow have been died to match our faces,Dolly Parton
Sittin' on the front porch swing Oh we'll dream of the time when the bloom was on the cotton,Dolly Parton
When our hearts chased the clouds like the swallows on their wings,Dolly Parton
But the words to the rhyme are the only things forgotten,Dolly Parton
Sittin' on the front porch swing,Dolly Parton
Sittin' on the front porch swing People always comin' up to me and askin',Dolly Parton
Well I'm not the Dalai Lama but I'll try,Dolly Parton
You better get to livin' givin',Dolly Parton
Don't forget to throw in a little forgivin',Dolly Parton
And lovin' on the way,Dolly Parton
You better get to knowin' showin',Dolly Parton
A little bit more concerned about where you're goin',Dolly Parton
Just a word unto the wise,Dolly Parton
You better get to livin'. A girlfriend came to my house,Dolly Parton
Started cryin' on my shoulder Sunday evening,Dolly Parton
She was spinnin' such a sad tale,Dolly Parton
I could not believe the yarn that she was weavin',Dolly Parton
So negative the words she had to say,Dolly Parton
I said if I had a violin I'd play. I said you'd better get to livin' givin',Dolly Parton
Be willing and forgivin',Dolly Parton
Cause all healing has to start with you,Dolly Parton
You better stop whining pining,Dolly Parton
Get your dreams in line,Dolly Parton
And then just shine design refine,Dolly Parton
Until they come true,Dolly Parton
And you better get to livin'. Your life's a wreck your house is mess,Dolly Parton
And your wardrobe way outdated,Dolly Parton
All your plans just keep on falling through,Dolly Parton
Overweight and under paid under appreciated,Dolly Parton

A little more thought about bein',Dolly Parton
A little more willin' to make a better way,Dolly Parton

Make some points for the great hereafter. Better start carin',Dolly Parton

Forever is the love that is filled with understanding,Dolly Parton
Forever is the love that is true and undemanding,Dolly Parton
Forever is the love that can stand the test of time,Dolly Parton
Forever I am yours say forever you'll be mine Trouble clouds may fill our skies,Dolly Parton
It might even rain awhile,Dolly Parton

Then I thought I heard somebody at my door a' knockin',Dolly Parton
I wondered who could be outdide in such an awful storm,Dolly Parton
Then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms,Dolly Parton
Before I could say a word she said 'My name is Sandy,Dolly Parton
And this here is my puppy dog it's name is little Andy',Dolly Parton
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress,Dolly Parton
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said Ain't ya got no gingerbread,Dolly Parton

God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone,Dolly Parton
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone Ain't ya got no gingerbread,Dolly Parton

How The Grinch Stole Christmas,Dr Seuss
by Dr. Suess,Dr Seuss
Every Who Down in Whoville Liked Christmas a lot,Dr Seuss
But the GrinchWho lived just north of Whoville Did NOT!,Dr Seuss
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!,Dr Seuss
Now please dont ask why. No one quite knows the reason.,Dr Seuss
It could be his head wasnt screwed on just right.,Dr Seuss
It could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.,Dr Seuss
But I think that the most likely reason of all,Dr Seuss
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.,Dr Seuss
Whatever the reason His heart or his shoes,Dr Seuss
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos,Dr Seuss
Staring down from his cave with a sour Grinchy frown,Dr Seuss
At the warm lighted windows below in their town.,Dr Seuss
For he knew every Who down in Whoville beneath,Dr Seuss
Was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath.,Dr Seuss
And theyre hanging their stockings! he snarled with a sneer,Dr Seuss
Tomorrow is Christmas! Its practically here!,Dr Seuss
Then he growled with his Grinch fingers nervously drumming,Dr Seuss
I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from coming!,Dr Seuss
For Tomorrow he knew all the Who girls and boys,Dr Seuss
Would wake bright and early. Theyd rush for their toys!,Dr Seuss
And then! Oh the noise! Oh the Noise!,Dr Seuss
Noise! Noise! Noise!,Dr Seuss
Thats one thing he hated! The NOISE!,Dr Seuss
NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!,Dr Seuss
Then the Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.,Dr Seuss
And theyd feast! And theyd feast! And theyd FEAST!,Dr Seuss
FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!,Dr Seuss
They would feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast beast.,Dr Seuss
Which was something the Grinch couldnt stand in the least!,Dr Seuss
And THEN Theyd do something He liked least of all!,Dr Seuss
Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small,Dr Seuss
Would stand close together with Christmas bells ringing.,Dr Seuss
Theyd stand hand in hand. And the Whos would start singing!,Dr Seuss
Theyd sing! And theyd sing! And theyd SING!,Dr Seuss
SING! SING! SING!,Dr Seuss
And the more the Grinch thought of this Who ChristmasSing,Dr Seuss
The more the Grinch thought I must stop this whole thing!,Dr Seuss
Why for fifty three years Ive put up with it now!,Dr Seuss
I MUST stop this Christmas from coming! But HOW?,Dr Seuss
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!,Dr Seuss
THE GRINCH GOT A WONDERFUL AWFUL IDEA!,Dr Seuss
I know just what to do! The Grinch laughed in his throat.,Dr Seuss
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a coat.,Dr Seuss
And he chuckled and clucked What a great Grinchy trick!,Dr Seuss
With this coat and this hat I look just like Saint Nick!,Dr Seuss
All I need is a reindeer The Grinch looked around.,Dr Seuss
But since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found.,Dr Seuss
Did that stop the old Grinch? No! The Grinch simply said,Dr Seuss
If I cant find a reindeer Ill make one instead!,Dr Seuss
So he called his dog Max. Then he took some red thread,Dr Seuss
And he tied a big horn on the top of his head.,Dr Seuss
THEN He loaded some bags And some old empty sacks,Dr Seuss
On a ramshackle sleigh And he hitched up old Max.,Dr Seuss
Then the Grinch said Giddap! And the sleigh started down,Dr Seuss
Toward the homes where the Whos Lay asnooze in their town.,Dr Seuss
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the air.,Dr Seuss
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.,Dr Seuss
When he came to the first little house on the square.,Dr Seuss
This is stop number one the old Grinchy Claus hissed,Dr Seuss
And he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist.,Dr Seuss
Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.,Dr Seuss
But if Santa could do it then so could the Grinch.,Dr Seuss
He got stuck only once for a moment or two.,Dr Seuss
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.,Dr Seuss
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.,Dr Seuss
These stockings he grinned are the first things to go!,Dr Seuss
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant,Dr Seuss
Around the whole room and he took every present!,Dr Seuss
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates! Drums!,Dr Seuss
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And plums!,Dr Seuss
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the Grinch very nimbly,Dr Seuss
Stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimney!,Dr Seuss
Then he slunk to the icebox. He took the Whos feast!,Dr Seuss
He took the Who pudding! He took the roast beast!,Dr Seuss
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.,Dr Seuss
Why that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash!,Dr Seuss
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.,Dr Seuss
And NOW! grinned the Grinch I will stuff up the tree!,Dr Seuss
And the Grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove,Dr Seuss
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.,Dr Seuss
He turned around fast and he saw a small Who!,Dr Seuss
Little Cindy Lou Who who was not more than two.,Dr Seuss
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter,Dr Seuss
Whod got out of bed for a cup of cold water.,Dr Seuss
She stared at the Grinch and said Santy Claus why????????????,Dr Seuss
Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?,Dr Seuss
But you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick,Dr Seuss
He thought up a lie and he thought it up quick!,Dr Seuss
Why my sweet little tot the fake Santy Claus lied,Dr Seuss
Theres a light on this tree that wont light on one side.,Dr Seuss
So Im taking it home to my workshop my dear.,Dr Seuss
Ill fix it up there. Then Ill bring it back here.,Dr Seuss
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her head,Dr Seuss
And he got her a drink and he sent her to bed.,Dr Seuss
And when CindyLou Who went to bed with her cup,Dr Seuss
HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up!,Dr Seuss
Then the last thing he took Was the log for their fire!,Dr Seuss
Then he went up the chimney himself the old liar.,Dr Seuss
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire.,Dr Seuss
And the one speck of food That he left in the house,Dr Seuss
Was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.,Dr Seuss
Then He did the same thing To the other Whos houses,Dr Seuss
Leaving crumbs Much too small For the other Whos mouses!,Dr Seuss
It was quarter past dawn All the Whos still a bed,Dr Seuss
All the Whos still asnooze When he packed up his sled,Dr Seuss
Packed it up with their presents! The ribbons! The wrappings!,Dr Seuss
The tags! And the tinsel! The trimmings! The trappings!,Dr Seuss
Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,Dr Seuss
He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!,Dr Seuss
PoohPooh to the Whos! he was grinchishly humming.,Dr Seuss
Theyre finding out now that no Christmas is coming!,Dr Seuss
Theyre just waking up! I know just what theyll do!,Dr Seuss
Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,Dr Seuss
Then the Whos down in Whoville will all cry BooHoo!,Dr Seuss
Thats a noise grinned the Grinch That I simply MUST hear!,Dr Seuss
So he paused. And the Grinch put his hand to his ear.,Dr Seuss
And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.,Dr Seuss
It started in low. Then it started to grow.,Dr Seuss
But the sound wasnt sad! Why this sound sounded merry!,Dr Seuss
It couldnt be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!,Dr Seuss
He stared down at Whoville! The Grinch popped his eyes!,Dr Seuss
Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!,Dr Seuss
Every Who down in Whoville the tall and the small,Dr Seuss
Was singing! Without any presents at all!,Dr Seuss
He HADNT stopped Christmas from coming! IT CAME!,Dr Seuss
Somehow or other it came just the same!,Dr Seuss
And the Grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow,Dr Seuss
Stood puzzling and puzzling How could it be so?,Dr Seuss
It came with out ribbons! It came without tags!,Dr Seuss
It came without packages boxes or bags!,Dr Seuss
And he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore.,Dr Seuss
Then the Grinch thought of something he hadnt before!,Dr Seuss
Maybe Christmas he thought doesnt come from a store.,Dr Seuss
Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more!,Dr Seuss
And what happened then? Wellin Whoville they say,Dr Seuss
That the Grinchs small heart Grew three sizes that day!,Dr Seuss
And the minute his heart didnt feel quite so tight,Dr Seuss
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning light,Dr Seuss
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the feast!,Dr Seuss
And he HE HIMSELF! The Grinch carved the roast beast!,Dr Seuss

We all fall down like toy soldiers,Eminem
Bit by bit torn apart,Eminem
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers I'm suppose to be the soldier who never blows his composure,Eminem
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders,Eminem
I ain't never suppose to show it my crew ain't suppose to know it,Eminem
Even if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino it don't matter,Eminem
I never drag 'em in battles that I can handle less I absolutely have to,Eminem
I'm suppose to set an example I need to be the leader,Eminem
My crew looks for me to guide 'em,Eminem
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em,Eminem
That Ja shit I tried to squashed it it was too late to stop it,Eminem
There's a certain line you just don't cross it and he crossed it,Eminem
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it,Eminem
It was crazy this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit,Eminem
And even though the battle was won I feel like we lost it,Eminem
I spent so much energy on it honestly I'm exhausted,Eminem
I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it,Eminem
This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for it's not why I got in it,Eminem
That was never my object for someone to get killed,Eminem
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build,Eminem
It wasn't my intentions my intentions were good,Eminem
I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning,Eminem
And that's just outta respect for not running my mouth,Eminem
And talking about something that I knew nothing about,Eminem
Plus Dre told me stay out just wasn't my beef So I did,Eminem
I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV,Eminem
Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life like fuck it,Eminem
I understand this is business and this shit just isn't none of my business,Eminem
But still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute cause Step by step heart to heart left right left,Eminem
We all fall down like toy soldiers,Eminem
Bit by bit torn apart,Eminem
We never win but the battle wages on for toy soldiers It used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme,Eminem
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying,Eminem
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it,Eminem
Shit gets escalated it ain't just words no more is it,Eminem
It's a different ball game call names and you ain't just rapping,Eminem
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening,Eminem
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him,Eminem
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him,Eminem
Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him,Eminem
Fuck 'em 50 smash him mash him and let him have it,Eminem
Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in other directions,Eminem
Some receptionist said the source who answers phones at his desk,Eminem
Has an erection for me and thinks,Eminem
That I'll be his resurrection,Eminem
Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record,Eminem
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up,Eminem
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous,Eminem
Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it,Eminem
That motherfucker can get it too fuck 'em then,Eminem
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think,Eminem
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc,Eminem
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind,Eminem
We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us,Eminem
As soon as we give the orders never to extort us,Eminem
Strictly to show they support us,Eminem
And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners,Eminem
Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is,Eminem
But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered,Eminem
It ain't worth it I can't think of a perfecter way to word it,Eminem
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict,Eminem
I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further,Eminem
But don't get it twisted it's not a plea that I'm coping,Eminem
I'm just willing to be the bigger man,Eminem
If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking,Eminem
'Cause frankly I'm sick of talking,Eminem
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause Step by step heart to heart left right left,Eminem

Standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair with some peroxide,Eminem
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?,Eminem

When they knew I was produced by Dre,Eminem
That's all it took,Eminem
And they were instantly hooked right in,Eminem
And they connected wit' me too because I looked like them,Eminem
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope,Eminem
Searchin' wit' a fine toothed comb,Eminem

Tightenin' around my throat,Eminem
Watchin' me while I write this like,Eminem

And piss on the lawns of the White House,Eminem
To burn the casket and replace it with a parental advisory sticker,Eminem
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy,Eminem
Fuck you Ms. Cheney,Eminem

And I can't change the way I am,Eminem
But if I offended you? Good,Eminem
'Cause I still don't give a fuck Zoning off one joint,Eminem
Stop in a limo hop in the window,Eminem
Shopping the demo with gun point,Eminem
A lyricist without a clue,Eminem
What year is this?,Eminem
Fuck a needle here's a sword body pierce with this,Eminem
Live in the muck never giving a fuck,Eminem
Give me the keys I'm drunk and I never driven a truck,Eminem
But I smoke dope in a cab,Eminem

A killer instinct runs in the blood,Eminem
Emptying full clips and bury your guns in the mud,Eminem
I've calmed down now,Eminem
I was heavy once into drugs,Eminem
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz,Eminem
My brains gone my souls warm my spirit is torn,Eminem
The rest of my body is still being operated on,Eminem
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme,Eminem
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time To all the weed that I've smoked,Eminem
Yo! this blunt's for you,Eminem
To all the people I've offended,Eminem

And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue,Eminem
I'll hang you till you dangle and chain you with both ankles,Eminem
And pull you apart from both angles,Eminem
I want to crush your skull till your brains leaks out of your veins,Eminem
And bust open like broken water mains,Eminem
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb,Eminem
'Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm,Eminem
I got your girl in my arm,Eminem
And I'm armed with a firearm,Eminem
So big my entire arm is a giant fire bomb,Eminem
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron on,Eminem
I get a master chick with a mouth full of adjectives,Eminem
'Causing hospital accidents,Eminem
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again To all the weed that I've smoked,Eminem
Yo! this blunt's for you,Eminem

Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt,Eminem
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet,Eminem
Drug sickness got me doing some bug switches,Eminem
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches,Eminem
I don't rap to get the woman fuck bitches,Eminem
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes,Eminem
Never ran with a click I'm a posse,Eminem
Kamikaze strapping a mother fucking bomb across me,Eminem
From the second I was born my momma lost me,Eminem
And I'm a cross between Manson Esham and Ozzy,Eminem
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place,Eminem
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday,Eminem
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?,Eminem

But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass! Sometimes I just feel like quittin' I still might,Eminem
Why do I put up this fight why do I still write,Eminem
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life,Eminem
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics,Eminem
And show these people what my level of skill's like,Eminem
But I'm still white sometimes I just hate life,Eminem
Somethin ain't right hit the brake lights,Eminem
Case of the stage fright drawin a blank like,Eminem
Great big eyeballs my insides crawl,Eminem
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut,Eminem

Just been stripped I have just been vicked,Eminem
So I must then get off the bus then split,Eminem
Man fuck this shit; yo I'm goin' the fuck home,Eminem
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man I'mma make a new plan,Eminem
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land,Eminem
Time to really just take matters into my own hands,Eminem
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back,Eminem
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own,Eminem
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road I'm walkin' these train tracks tryin' to regain back,Eminem
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap,Eminem
To the same plant and the same pants,Eminem
Tryin' to chase rap gotta move ASAP,Eminem
And get a new plan momma's got a new man,Eminem
Poor little baby sister she don't understand,Eminem
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in the pad,Eminem
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand,Eminem
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad,Eminem
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head,Eminem
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had,Eminem
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!,Eminem
Sometimes I get upset cause I ain't blew up yet,Eminem
It's like I grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet,Eminem
Don't gotta rep my step don't got enough pep,Eminem
The pressure's too much man I'm just tryin' to do what's best,Eminem
And I try sit alone and I cry,Eminem
Yo I won't tell no lie not a moment goes by,Eminem
That I don't pray to the sky please I'm beggin' you God,Eminem
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job,Eminem
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are,Eminem
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow,Eminem
Tell my mother I love her kiss baby sister goodbye,Eminem
Say whenever you need me baby I'm never too far,Eminem
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know,Eminem
And I'mma be back for you the second that I blow,Eminem
On everything I own I'll make it on my own,Eminem
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man I'mma make a new plan,Eminem
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land,Eminem
Time to really just take matters into my own hands,Eminem
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back,Eminem
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own,Eminem
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road You gotta live it to feel it you didn't you wouldn't get it,Eminem
Or see what the big deal is why it was and it still is,Eminem
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits,Eminem
It's different it's a certain significance a certificate,Eminem
Of authenticity you'd never even see,Eminem
But it's everything to me it's my credibility,Eminem
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC,Eminem
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me,Eminem
But yet I'm still unsigned havin' a rough time,Eminem
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes,Eminem
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline,Eminem
But when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go,Eminem
Who must I show to bust my flow,Eminem
Where must I go who must I know,Eminem
Or am I just another crab in the bucket,Eminem
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it,Eminem
Maybe I need a new outlet I'm startin to doubt shit,Eminem
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with,Eminem
I look like a bum yo my clothes ain't about shit,Eminem
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit,Eminem
And it's cold tryin' to travel this road,Eminem
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode,Eminem
My defenses are so up but one thing I don't want,Eminem
Is pity from no one the city is no fun,Eminem
There is no sun and it's so dark,Eminem
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart,Eminem
From each one of my limbs by each one of my friends,Eminem
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin,Eminem
Sometimes I feel like a robot sometimes I just know not,Eminem
What I'm doin I just blow my head is a stove top,Eminem
I just explode the kettle gets so hot,Eminem
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got,Eminem
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned,Eminem
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl,Eminem
I can no longer play stupid or be immature,Eminem
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage,Eminem
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words,Eminem
Got the urge suddenly it's a surge,Eminem
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred,Eminem
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third,Eminem
I am no longer scared now I'm free as a bird,Eminem
Then I turn and cross over the median curb,Eminem
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road I'm a man I'mma make a new plan,Eminem
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land,Eminem
Time to really just take matters into my own hands,Eminem
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back,Eminem
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own,Eminem

We rolling circles and packs we the lifesavers,Eminem
She got a boyfriend I got a toy then,Eminem
I'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving,Eminem
And I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor,Eminem
I'm so Jay Electronic I'm cut like I'm all out of razors,Eminem
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it,Eminem
Next ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store,Eminem
With a about a million dollars with your mama,Eminem
And sat down did an ALS challenge huh,Eminem
I stole that adlib from French Bad & Evil back at it again,Eminem
About to get my back tatted again,Eminem
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand,Eminem
Sitting on a bike in the sand,Eminem
If you ain't been through nothing,Eminem
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram,Eminem
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a lamp,Eminem
Weed got her so chinky eyed,Eminem
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan,Eminem
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking,Eminem
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can,Eminem
Listen though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss,Eminem
If this is my passion,Eminem
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence,Eminem
The gift of my absence,Eminem
I don't know who you been listening to,Eminem
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop,Eminem
Bitch I don't give a two shits,Eminem
Bitch get the fuck out of my face,Eminem
To make a long story short I don't really gotta stand there,Eminem
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum,Eminem
Even though I have an affinity for witty banter,Eminem
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer,Eminem
Hold up she misunderstood me,Eminem
I said saint por favor,Eminem
Thought I said to wait had four doors,Eminem
I knock a nigga face off,Eminem

Won't even get a cab for you and your friend,Eminem
The only fear I have is of loathing,Eminem

Cause I'm happy Yeah I'm happy,Eminem
Ha Ha,Eminem
I got my baby back,Eminem
Yo check it out Some days I sit starin' out the window,Eminem
Watchin' this world pass me by,Eminem
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for,Eminem
I almost break down and cry,Eminem
Sometimes I think I'm crazy,Eminem
I'm crazy oh so crazy,Eminem
Why am I here am I just wastin' my time?,Eminem
But then I see my baby,Eminem
Suddenly I'm not crazy,Eminem
Everyone's leanin' on me,Eminem
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over,Eminem
But then she comes back to me My baby girl keeps gettin' older,Eminem
I watch her grow up with pride,Eminem
People make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me,Eminem
They just don't see my real side,Eminem
I act like shit don't phase me,Eminem
Inside it drives me crazy,Eminem
My insecurities could eat me alive,Eminem
But then I see my baby,Eminem
Suddenly I'm not crazy,Eminem
Everyone's leanin' on me,Eminem
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over,Eminem
But then she comes back to me Man if I could sing I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter,Eminem
If I could hit the notes I'd blow somethin' as long as my father,Eminem
To show her how I feel about her how proud I am that I got 'er,Eminem
God I'm a daddy I'm so glad that her mom didn't abort,Eminem
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona,Eminem
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest,Eminem
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul,Eminem
And just know that I grow cold of the older I grow,Eminem
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harda to hold,Eminem
And this load is like the weight of the world,Eminem
And I think my neck is breakin',Eminem
Should I just give up,Eminem
Or try to live up to these expectations?,Eminem
Now look,Eminem
I love my daughter more than life n' itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell,Eminem
But I handle it well given the circumstances I'm dealt,Eminem
So many chances man it's too bad coulda had someone else,Eminem
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted,Eminem
So here's what I'm facin' 3 felonies 6 years of probation,Eminem
I've went to jail for this woman I've been to bat for this woman,Eminem
I've taken bats to people's backs bent over backwards for this woman,Eminem
Man I should of seen it comin' what'd I stick my penis up in?,Eminem
But fuck it it's over there's no more reason to cry no more,Eminem
I got my baby maybe the only lady that I adore Hailie,Eminem
So sayonara try tomorra nice to know ya,Eminem
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner,Eminem
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted,Eminem
It's like the greatest gift you can get,Eminem
The weight has been lifted,Eminem
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders,Eminem
Everyone's leanin' on me,Eminem
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's her soldier,Eminem
Nothin' can take her from me Woo!,Eminem
I told you I can't sing,Eminem
Oh well I tried,Eminem
Hailie remember when I said If you ever need anything daddy will be right there?,Eminem
Well guess what daddy's here,Eminem
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby,Eminem

I want to dig my way to hell,Eminem
I want to dig my way to hell Guess I got a way with words I could get away with murder,Eminem
Ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition,Eminem
It's what you're suffering from when you simply don't care if its an,Eminem
Eighty degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning,Eminem
And you can't see the b****'s hair is frizzin',Eminem
'Cause you got the windows up blaring the system in your Chevrolet Prism The devil ain't on the level same as him,Eminem
Just someone who rebels in straight masochism,Eminem
And imagine him giving him an adjective an a** whooping,Eminem
So bad they should put his a** in prison,Eminem
I word bully I verbally abuse verbs like he did something to me personally,Eminem
Used forgetfully so I cut class and ditch it now I fully rap Cadillac from a K Car my a** from a hole in the ground still can't tell em apart,Eminem
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud,Eminem
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are,Eminem
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad,Eminem
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart,Eminem
In the middle of the aisle whilin I don't give a f*** I don't play!,Eminem
You think you saw this basket first?,Eminem
Yeah backwards like motherf***ing Bob and Silent Jay,Eminem
Illest s*** you could think I would say,Eminem
Mind's like a pile of clay,Eminem
When's the last time you saw a villain with a cape?,Eminem
With a gaping hole in it,Eminem
Whip out whip down Tied him around my neck went down the fire escape of the Empire State,Eminem
Straight fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state,Eminem
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates,Eminem
So Satan stuck his face in an ashtray,Eminem
But I sacheted around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face,Eminem
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scalar,Eminem
Being gay little faggot but by the way,Eminem
Plus it's getting darker by the day,Eminem
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey Tyler the Creator and Violent Jay It's a f***ing miracle to be this lyrical,Eminem
Paint my face with clown make up and a smiley face I'm insane,Eminem
Every rhyme I say a**aults you like an ultra violet ray,Eminem
I'm sellin' hatred buffet style all the s*** you can eat,Eminem
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate,Eminem
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise,Eminem
With the rhyme I'm spittin' while I'm s***tin' on the competition,Eminem
In the meantime it's always mean time I'm getting by with my wicked ways,Eminem
I'm loading up and I'm taking names,Eminem
I want to dig my way to hell,Eminem

But I was put here not by accident,Eminem
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish,Eminem
Slaughter tracks I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this s***,Eminem
And I'm coming to get that quarter back,Eminem
Like Ndamukong the drama can build,Eminem
Your mama can ask me for my autograph,Eminem
That cougars a MILF she's the oldest trick in the book,Eminem
But I sure would fall for that,Eminem
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight,Eminem
When I get on the mic I'm a snap,Eminem
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital,Eminem
When I overdosed would have caught a flat If it makes you sick to your stomach pass it,Eminem
Indigestion my suggestions's Kaopectate,Eminem
If it feels like I'm running away with the game,Eminem
Its 'cause I am don't speculate spectate,Eminem
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades,Eminem
But I get by my wicked ways lady you can suck a dick till your neck aches,Eminem
Cry till you get puffy eyes red face,Eminem
But I'm leaving on this jet plane,Eminem
You ain't fly you're an airhead,Eminem
I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole sorry another catchphrase,Eminem
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage over headspace,Eminem
'Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods,Eminem
Other words don't try to put the heart in a headcase 'Cause baby stable mentally I ain't I need my meds I peed my bed,Eminem
I'm going blind I don't see my legs I keep on falling down,Eminem
No wonder you can't stand me I need my cane,Eminem
Someone help me I think my face is melting,Eminem
If you felt these migrains see these maggots eat my brain,Eminem
If you read my mind you can see my pain,Eminem
And you could see why I'd be this way,Eminem
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes,Eminem
Psycho on a cycle,Eminem
If I hear Iko,Eminem
I'm out of control like no,Eminem
Nothing but a hole inside your skull where you eye close,Eminem
Cause I'm gonna sock it to you dyko you don't like it,Eminem
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it like a motorbike,Eminem

Blow it out your a** As I fall deeper into a manic state,Eminem
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits,Eminem
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate,Eminem
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nighquil then I salivate,Eminem
Start off with the Nighquil like I think I'll just have a taste,Eminem
Couple sips of that then I gradually graduate,Eminem
Too a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great,Eminem
I go to take just one and I end up like having eight,Eminem
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate,Eminem
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak,Eminem

To see if I still feel,Johnny Cash

The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole,Johnny Cash
The old familiar sting,Johnny Cash
Try to kill it all away,Johnny Cash
But I remember everything What have I become,Johnny Cash
My sweetest friend,Johnny Cash
Everyone I know,Johnny Cash
Goes away in the end And you could have it all,Johnny Cash
My empire of dirt,Johnny Cash
I will let you down,Johnny Cash
I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorns,Johnny Cash
Upon my liars chair,Johnny Cash
Full of broken thoughts,Johnny Cash
I cannot repair Beneath the stains of time,Johnny Cash
The feelings disappear,Johnny Cash

A million miles away,Johnny Cash
I will keep myself,Johnny Cash
I would find a way I hear the train a comin',Johnny Cash
It's rollin' 'round the bend,Johnny Cash
And I ain't seen the sunshine,Johnny Cash
Since I don't know when,Johnny Cash
I'm stuck in Folsom Prison,Johnny Cash
And time keeps draggin' on,Johnny Cash
But that train keeps a-rollin',Johnny Cash
On down to San Antone When I was just a baby,Johnny Cash
My Mama told me son,Johnny Cash
Always be a good boy,Johnny Cash
Don't ever play with guns,Johnny Cash
But I shot a man in Reno,Johnny Cash
Just to watch him die,Johnny Cash
When I hear that whistle blowin',Johnny Cash
I hang my head and cry I bet there's rich folks eatin',Johnny Cash
In a fancy dining car,Johnny Cash
They're probably drinkin' coffee,Johnny Cash
And smokin' big cigars,Johnny Cash
But I know I had it comin',Johnny Cash
I know I can't be free,Johnny Cash
But those people keep a-movin',Johnny Cash
And that's what tortures me Well if they freed me from this prison,Johnny Cash
If that railroad train was mine,Johnny Cash
I bet I'd move out over a little,Johnny Cash
Farther down the line,Johnny Cash
Far from Folsom Prison,Johnny Cash
That's where I want to stay,Johnny Cash
And I'd let that lonesome whistle,Johnny Cash
Blow my blues away Well I woke up Sunday morning,Johnny Cash
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt,Johnny Cash
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,Johnny Cash
So I had one more for dessert,Johnny Cash
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes,Johnny Cash
And found my cleanest dirty shirt,Johnny Cash
Then I washed my face and combed my hair,Johnny Cash
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day I'd smoked my mind the night before,Johnny Cash
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking,Johnny Cash
But I lit my first and watched a small kid,Johnny Cash
Playing with a can that he was kicking,Johnny Cash
Then I walked across the street,Johnny Cash
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken,Johnny Cash
And Lord it took me back to something that I'd lost,Johnny Cash
Somewhere somehow along the way On a Sunday morning sidewalk,Johnny Cash
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned,Johnny Cash
'Cause there's something in a Sunday,Johnny Cash
That makes a body feel alone,Johnny Cash
And there's nothing short a' dying,Johnny Cash
That's half as lonesome as the sound,Johnny Cash
Of the sleeping city sidewalk,Johnny Cash
And Sunday morning coming down In the park I saw a daddy,Johnny Cash
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging,Johnny Cash
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,Johnny Cash
And listened to the songs they were singing,Johnny Cash
Then I headed down the street,Johnny Cash
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing,Johnny Cash
And it echoed through the canyons,Johnny Cash
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday On a Sunday morning sidewalk,Johnny Cash
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned,Johnny Cash
'Cause there's something in a Sunday,Johnny Cash
That makes a body feel alone,Johnny Cash
And there's nothing short a' dying,Johnny Cash
That's half as lonesome as the sound,Johnny Cash
Of the sleeping city sidewalk,Johnny Cash
And Sunday morning coming down You can run on for a long time,Johnny Cash

I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee,Johnny Cash

So it stood ninety years on the floor,Johnny Cash
It was taller by half than the old man himself,Johnny Cash
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born,Johnny Cash
And was always his treasure and pride,Johnny Cash
But it stopped short never to go again,Johnny Cash
When the old man died Ninety years without slumbering,Johnny Cash
His life seconds numbering,Johnny Cash
It stopped short never to go again,Johnny Cash
When the old man died My grandfather said that of those he could hire,Johnny Cash
Not a servant so faithful he found,Johnny Cash
For it wasted no time and had but one desire,Johnny Cash
At the close of each week to be wound And it kept in its place not a frown upon its face,Johnny Cash
And its hands never hung by its side,Johnny Cash
But it stopped short never to go again,Johnny Cash
When the old man died It rang and alarmed in the dead of the night,Johnny Cash
An alarm that for years had been dumb,Johnny Cash
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight,Johnny Cash
That his hour for departure had come Still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime,Johnny Cash
As we silently stood by his side,Johnny Cash
But it stopped short never to go again,Johnny Cash
When the old man died Ninety years without slumbering,Johnny Cash
His life seconds numbering,Johnny Cash
It stopped short never to go again,Johnny Cash
When the old man died Some glad morning when this life is o'er,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away.,Johnny Cash
To that home on God's celestial shore,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away. I'll fly away oh glory I'll fly away.,Johnny Cash
When I die Hallelujah by and by,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away.,Johnny Cash
Just a few more weary days and then,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away. To that land where joy will never end,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away.,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away oh glory I'll fly away.,Johnny Cash
When I die Hallelujah by and by,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away. Oh I'll fly away oh glory I'll fly away in the morning,Johnny Cash
When I die Hallelujah by and by,Johnny Cash
I'll fly away. Well you wonder why I always dress in black,Johnny Cash
Why you never see bright colors on my back,Johnny Cash
And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone.,Johnny Cash
Well there's a reason for the things that I have on. I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,Johnny Cash
Livin' in the hopeless hungry side of town,Johnny Cash
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime,Johnny Cash
But is there because he's a victim of the times. I wear the black for those who never read,Johnny Cash
Or listened to the words that Jesus said,Johnny Cash
About the road to happiness through love and charity,Johnny Cash
Why you'd think He's talking straight to you and me. Well we're doin' mighty fine I do suppose,Johnny Cash
In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,Johnny Cash
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back,Johnny Cash
Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black. I wear it for the sick and lonely old,Johnny Cash
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold,Johnny Cash
I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been,Johnny Cash
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. And I wear it for the thousands who have died,Johnny Cash
Believen' that the Lord was on their side,Johnny Cash
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,Johnny Cash
Believen' that we all were on their side. Well there's things that never will be right I know,Johnny Cash
And things need changin' everywhere you go,Johnny Cash
But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right,Johnny Cash
You'll never see me wear a suit of white. Ah I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,Johnny Cash
And tell the world that everything's OK,Johnny Cash
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,Johnny Cash
Till things are brighter I'm the Man In Black Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds,Johnny Cash
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down,Johnny Cash
I went right home and I went to bed,Johnny Cash
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head. Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun,Johnny Cash
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run,Johnny Cash
Made a good run but I run too slow,Johnny Cash
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico. Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill,Johnny Cash
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill,Johnny Cash
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown,Johnny Cash
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down. I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee,Johnny Cash
If you've got a warrant just read it to me,Johnny Cash
Shot her down cause she made me slow,Johnny Cash
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more. When I was arrested I was dressed in black,Johnny Cash
They put me on a train and they took me back,Johnny Cash
Had no friends for to go my bail,Johnny Cash
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail. Early next morning about a half past nine,Johnny Cash
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line,Johnny Cash
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat,Johnny Cash
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court Into the court room my trial began,Johnny Cash
Where I was handled by twelve honest men,Johnny Cash
Just before the jury started out,Johnny Cash
I saw that little judge commence to look about. In about five minutes in walked a man,Johnny Cash
Holding the verdict in his right hand,Johnny Cash
The verdict read in the first degree,Johnny Cash
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen,Johnny Cash
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen,Johnny Cash
Ninety nine years underneath that ground,Johnny Cash
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down,Johnny Cash
Come on you gotta listen unto me,Johnny Cash
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be Oh Danny Boy the pipes the pipes are calling,Johnny Cash
From glen to glen and down the mountain side,Johnny Cash
The summer's gone and all the roses falling,Johnny Cash
It's you It's you must go and I must bide But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,Johnny Cash
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,Johnny Cash
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,Johnny Cash
Oh Danny Boy oh Danny Boy I love you so But if you come and all the flowers are dying,Johnny Cash
And I am dead as dead I well may be,Johnny Cash
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,Johnny Cash
And kneel and say an Ave there for me And I will know tho' soft ye tread above me,Johnny Cash
And then my grave will richer sweeter be,Johnny Cash
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me,Johnny Cash
And I will rest in peace until you come to me There's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it apart,Johnny Cash
For the father waits over the way to prepare us a dwelling place there,Johnny Cash
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore,Johnny Cash
In the sweet by and by we shall meet on that beautiful shore We shall meet on the beautiful shore,Johnny Cash
We shall sing on that beautiful shore for the melodious songs of the blessed,Johnny Cash
And our spirits shall sorrow no more not a sight for the blessing of rest,Johnny Cash
In the sweet by and by To a bountiful father above we shall offer our tribute of praise,Johnny Cash
For the glory as gift of his love and the blessing that howlered days,Johnny Cash
In the sweet by and by,Johnny Cash
In the sweet by and by If you're travelin' in the north country fair,Johnny Cash
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,Johnny Cash
Remember me to one who lives there,Johnny Cash
Oh she once was a true love of mine See for me if her hair's hanging down,Johnny Cash
It curls and falls all down her breast,Johnny Cash
See for me that her hair's hanging down,Johnny Cash
That's the way I remember her best If you go when the snowflakes falls,Johnny Cash
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,Johnny Cash
Please see for me if she's wearing a coat so warm,Johnny Cash
To keep her from the howlin' winds If you're travelin' in the north country fair,Johnny Cash
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,Johnny Cash
Please say hello to the one who lives there,Johnny Cash
Oh she was once a true love of mine If you're travelin' in the north country fair,Johnny Cash
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,Johnny Cash
Remember me to one who lives there,Johnny Cash
Oh she once was a true love of mine A true love of mine,Johnny Cash
A true love of mine,Johnny Cash
True love of mine,Johnny Cash
A true love of mine,Johnny Cash
A true love of mine,Johnny Cash
She was once a true love of mine I keep a close watch on this heart of mine,Johnny Cash
I keep my eyes wide open all the time,Johnny Cash
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds,Johnny Cash
Because you're mine I walk the line I find it very very easy to be true,Johnny Cash
I find myself alone when each day's through,Johnny Cash
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you,Johnny Cash
Because you're mine I walk the line As sure as night is dark and day is light,Johnny Cash
I keep you on my mind both day and night,Johnny Cash
And happiness I've known proves that it's right,Johnny Cash
Because you're mine I walk the line You've got a way to keep me on your side,Johnny Cash
You give me cause for love that I can't hide,Johnny Cash
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide,Johnny Cash
Because you're mine I walk the line I keep a close watch on this heart of mine,Johnny Cash
I keep my eyes wide open all the time,Johnny Cash
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds,Johnny Cash
Because you're mine I walk the line Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,Johnny Cash
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.,Johnny Cash
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.,Johnny Cash
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl Southern drawl.,Johnny Cash
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,Johnny Cash
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone boy she's gone.,Johnny Cash
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the block.,Johnny Cash
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone. Now won't you batter down by Baton Rouge River Queen roll it on.,Johnny Cash
Take that woman on down to New Orleans New Orleans.,Johnny Cash
Go on I've had enough dump my blues down in the gulf.,Johnny Cash
She loves you Big River more than me. Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry cry cry,Johnny Cash
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.,Johnny Cash
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.,Johnny Cash
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die. There ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna rise right out of the ground,Johnny Cash
Ain't no grave can hold my body down Well look way down the river what do you think I see?,Johnny Cash
I see a band of angels and they're coming after me,Johnny Cash
Ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down Well look down yonder Gabriel put your feet on the land and see,Johnny Cash
But Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet 'til you hear it from me,Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
Ain't no grave can hold my body down Well meet me Jesus meet me. Meet me in the middle of the air,Johnny Cash
And if these wings don't fail me I will meet you anywhere,Johnny Cash
Ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down Well meet me mother and father meet me down the river road,Johnny Cash
And momma you know that I'll be there when I check in my load,Johnny Cash
Ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down,Johnny Cash
There ain't no grave can hold my body down I want to live,Johnny Cash
I want to give,Johnny Cash
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.,Johnny Cash
It's these expressions I never give,Johnny Cash
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold,Johnny Cash
And I'm getting old.,Johnny Cash
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold,Johnny Cash
And I'm getting old. I've been to Hollywood,Johnny Cash
I've been to redwood,Johnny Cash
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold,Johnny Cash
I've been in my mind it's such a fine line,Johnny Cash
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold,Johnny Cash
And I'm getting old.,Johnny Cash
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold,Johnny Cash
And I'm getting old. You keep me searching for a heart of gold,Johnny Cash
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.,Johnny Cash
And I'm getting old. Well I left Kentucky back in forty nine,Johnny Cash
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line,Johnny Cash
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on Cadillacs Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by,Johnny Cash
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry,Johnny Cash
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black. One day I devised myself a plan,Johnny Cash
That should be the envy of most any man,Johnny Cash
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand,Johnny Cash
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired,Johnny Cash
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired,Johnny Cash
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand. I'd get it one piece at a time,Johnny Cash
And it wouldn't cost me a dime,Johnny Cash
You'll know it's me when I come through your town,Johnny Cash
I'm gonna ride around in style,Johnny Cash
I'm gonna drive everybody wild,Johnny Cash
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around. So the very next day when I punched in,Johnny Cash
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends,Johnny Cash
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears,Johnny Cash
I've never considered myself a thief,Johnny Cash
But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece,Johnny Cash
Especially if I strung it out over several years. The first day I got me a fuel pump,Johnny Cash
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk,Johnny Cash
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome,Johnny Cash
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox,Johnny Cash
Like nuts an' bolts and all four shocks,Johnny Cash
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home. Now up to now my plan went all right,Johnny Cash
'Til we tried to put it all together one night,Johnny Cash
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong. The transmission was a fifty three,Johnny Cash
And the motor turned out to be a seventy three,Johnny Cash
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone. So we drilled it out so that it would fit,Johnny Cash
And with a little bit of help with an adapter kit,Johnny Cash
We had that engine runnin' just like a song,Johnny Cash
Now the headlight' was another sight,Johnny Cash
We had two on the left and one on the right,Johnny Cash
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on. The back end looked kinda funny too,Johnny Cash
But we put it together and when we got through,Johnny Cash
Well that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin,Johnny Cash
About that time my wife walked out,Johnny Cash
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts,Johnny Cash
But she opened the door and said Honey take me for a spin. So we drove up town just to get the tags,Johnny Cash
And I headed her right on down main drag,Johnny Cash
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around,Johnny Cash
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh,Johnny Cash
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff,Johnny Cash
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds. I got it one piece at a time,Johnny Cash
And it wouldn't cost me a dime,Johnny Cash
You'll know it's me when I come through your town,Johnny Cash
I'm gonna ride around in style,Johnny Cash
I'm gonna drive everybody wild,Johnny Cash
Cause I'll have the only one there is around. Ugh! Yeah RED RYDER,Johnny Cash
This is the COTTON MOUTH,Johnny Cash
In the PSYCHO-BILLY CADILLAC Come on Huh This is the COTTON MOUTH,Johnny Cash
And negatory on the cost of this mow-chine there RED RYDER,Johnny Cash
You might say I went right up to the factory,Johnny Cash
And picked it up it's cheaper that way,Johnny Cash
Ugh! what model is it? Well It's a '49 '50 '51 '52 '53 '54 '55 '56,Johnny Cash
57 '58' 59' automobile,Johnny Cash
It's a '60 '61 '62 '63 '64 '65 '66 '67,Johnny Cash
68 '69 '70 automobile. Ten years ago on a cold dark night,Johnny Cash
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light,Johnny Cash
There were few at the scene but they all agreed,Johnny Cash
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me She walks these hills in a long black veil,Johnny Cash
She visits my grave when the night winds wail,Johnny Cash
Nobody knows nobody sees,Johnny Cash
Nobody knows but me The judge said son what is your alibi,Johnny Cash
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die,Johnny Cash
I spoke not a word thou it meant my life,Johnny Cash
I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife Did I hear someone applaud? Now the scaffold is high and eternity's near,Johnny Cash
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear,Johnny Cash
But sometimes at night when the north wind moans,Johnny Cash
In a long black veil she cries ov're my bones She walks these hills in a long black veil,Johnny Cash
She visits my grave when the night winds wail,Johnny Cash
Nobody knows nobody sees,Johnny Cash
Nobody knows but me Can I have a glass of water?,Johnny Cash
huh? Alright,Johnny Cash
Lemme have a have a drink of water. I'm about to choke up,Johnny Cash
That's cocaine blues.,Johnny Cash
We got a special surprise for you fellas,Johnny Cash
And especially for one fella.,Johnny Cash
In a few minutes we're going to record a brand new song that,Johnny Cash
I just sang last night for the first time,Johnny Cash
It was written by someone here in Folsom prison,Johnny Cash
Can I have a drink of water?,Johnny Cash
Last time last time I was here I had a drink of water,Johnny Cash
And uh I don't know what the hell it run off,Johnny Cash
I think it must have run off Luther's boots or something,Johnny Cash
Is that water?,Johnny Cash
You promise that's water huh,Johnny Cash
Is that water bob?,Johnny Cash
That's water,Johnny Cash
Serve everything in tin cups?,Johnny Cash
He caught it didn't he?,Johnny Cash
I have an announcement here,Johnny Cash
Sandoval Sandoval S-A-N-D-O-V-A-L. Sandoval,Johnny Cash
Eighty eight four one nine is wanted in reception I asked my love to take a walk,Johnny Cash
Take a walk just a little ways,Johnny Cash
And as we walked along we talk,Johnny Cash
All would be our wedding day And only say that you'll be mine,Johnny Cash
In no others arms entwined,Johnny Cash
Down beside where the waters flow,Johnny Cash
Down by the banks of the Ohio I asked her if she'd marry me,Johnny Cash
And my wife forever be,Johnny Cash
She only turned her head away,Johnny Cash
And had no other words to say And only say that you'll be mine,Johnny Cash
In no others arms entwined,Johnny Cash
Down beside where the waters flow,Johnny Cash
Down by the banks of the Ohio I plunged a knife into her breast,Johnny Cash
And told her she was going to rest,Johnny Cash
And drug her down to the river side,Johnny Cash
And there I threw her into drown,Johnny Cash
And I watched her as she floated down And only say that you'll be mine,Johnny Cash
In no others arms entwined,Johnny Cash
Down beside where the waters flow,Johnny Cash
Down by the banks of the Ohio And going home between twelve and one,Johnny Cash
I cried Oh Lord what have I've done?,Johnny Cash
I've killed the only girl I love,Johnny Cash
Because she would not marry me And only say that you'll be mine,Johnny Cash
In no others arms entwined,Johnny Cash
Down beside where the waters flow,Johnny Cash
Down by the banks of the Ohio Well my daddy left home when I was three,Johnny Cash
And he didn't leave much to Ma and me,Johnny Cash
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze,Johnny Cash
Now I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid,Johnny Cash
But the meanest thing that he ever did,Johnny Cash
Was before he left he went and named me Sue Well he must o' thought that is quite a joke,Johnny Cash
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,Johnny Cash
It seems I had to fight my whole life through,Johnny Cash
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red,Johnny Cash
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,Johnny Cash
I tell ya life ain't easy for a boy named Sue Well I grew up quick and I grew up mean,Johnny Cash
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,Johnny Cash
Roam from town to town to hide my shame,Johnny Cash
But I made me a vow to the moon and stars,Johnny Cash
I'd search the honky-tonks and bars,Johnny Cash
And kill that man who gave me that awful name Well it was Gatlinburg in mid-July,Johnny Cash
And I just hit town and my throat was dry,Johnny Cash
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew,Johnny Cash
At an old saloon on a street of mud,Johnny Cash
There at a table dealing stud,Johnny Cash
Sat the dirty mangy dog that named me Sue Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad,Johnny Cash
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had,Johnny Cash
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye,Johnny Cash
He was big and bent and gray and old,Johnny Cash
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold,Johnny Cash
Yeah that's what I told 'em Well I hit him hard right between the eyes,Johnny Cash
And he went down but to my surprise,Johnny Cash
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear,Johnny Cash
But I busted a chair right across his teeth,Johnny Cash
And we crashed through the wall and into the street,Johnny Cash
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer I tell ya I've fought tougher men,Johnny Cash
But I really can't remember when,Johnny Cash
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile,Johnny Cash
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,Johnny Cash
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,Johnny Cash
Always be a good boy,Johnny Cash
One of the four beasts saying,Johnny Cash
And I looked and behold a pale horse,Johnny Cash
And you can tell your dad that I'm coming back a richer man,Johnny Cash
Learn to hoist a jack and learn to lay a track learn to pick and shovel too,Johnny Cash
That's the pay for a steel driver on this line. Then the section foreman said Hey! Hammer-swinger!,Johnny Cash
Pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to,Johnny Cash
Go on and do what you say you can do With a steel-nosed hammer on a four foot switch handle,Johnny Cash
John Henry raised it back 'til it touched his heels then,Johnny Cash
The spike went through the cross-tie and split it half in two,Johnny Cash
Thirty-five cents a day for driving steel,Johnny Cash
Said Sweat boy! Sweat! Only two more swings!,Johnny Cash
I was born drivin' steel Well now John Henry hammered in the mountains,Johnny Cash
He'd give a grunt he give a groan every swing,Johnny Cash
The women-folks from miles around heard him and come down,Johnny Cash
But if you'll bring that steamdrill 'round I'll beat it fair and honest.,Johnny Cash
I'll die with that hammer in my hand but I'll be laughin',Johnny Cash
Cause you can't replace a steel-drivin' man. There was a big crowd of people at the mountain.,Johnny Cash
It ain't nothin' but my hammer suckin' wind it keeps me breathin',Johnny Cash
I believe the lady's name was Paulie Ann yeah that was his good woman,Johnny Cash
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home,Johnny Cash
Early next mornin' he said,Johnny Cash
Constantly in the darkness,Joni Mitchell
Where's that at,Joni Mitchell

And put up a parking lot They took all the trees,Joni Mitchell
And put them in a tree museum,Joni Mitchell
And they charged all the people,Joni Mitchell
A dollar and a half to see 'em,Joni Mitchell

That you don't know what you've got,Joni Mitchell
'Till it's gone,Joni Mitchell

And put up a parking lot They paved paradise,Joni Mitchell
Put up a parking lot Rows and flows of angel hair,Joni Mitchell
And ice cream castles in the air,Joni Mitchell
And feather canyons everywhere,Joni Mitchell
I've looked at clouds that way But now they only block the sun,Joni Mitchell
They rain and snow on everyone,Joni Mitchell
So many things I would have done,Joni Mitchell
But clouds got in my way I've looked at clouds from both sides now,Joni Mitchell
From up and down and still somehow,Joni Mitchell
It's cloud's illusions I recall,Joni Mitchell
I really don't know clouds at all Moons and Junes and ferries wheels,Joni Mitchell
The dizzy dancing way you feel,Joni Mitchell
As every fairy tale comes real,Joni Mitchell
I've looked at love that way But now it's just another show,Joni Mitchell
You leave 'em laughing when you go,Joni Mitchell
And if you care don't let them know,Joni Mitchell
Don't give yourself away I've looked at love from both sides now,Joni Mitchell
From give and take and still somehow,Joni Mitchell
It's love's illusions I recall,Joni Mitchell
I really don't know love at all Tears and fears and feeling proud,Joni Mitchell
To say I love you right out loud,Joni Mitchell
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds,Joni Mitchell
I've looked at life that way But now old friends they're acting strange,Joni Mitchell
They shake their heads they say I've changed,Joni Mitchell
Well something's lost but something's gained,Joni Mitchell
In living every day. I've looked at life from both sides now,Joni Mitchell
From win and lose and still somehow,Joni Mitchell
It's life's illusions I recall,Joni Mitchell
I really don't know life at all I've looked at life from both sides now,Joni Mitchell
From up and down and still somehow,Joni Mitchell
It's life's illusions I recall,Joni Mitchell
I really don't know life at all Yesterday a child came out to wonder,Joni Mitchell
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar,Joni Mitchell
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder,Joni Mitchell
And tearful at the falling of a star,Joni Mitchell
And the seasons they go round and round,Joni Mitchell
And the painted ponies go up and down,Joni Mitchell
We're captive on the carousel of time,Joni Mitchell
We can't return we can only look behind,Joni Mitchell
From where we came,Joni Mitchell
And go round and round and round,Joni Mitchell
In the circle game Then the child moved ten times round the seasons,Joni Mitchell
Skated over ten clear frozen streams,Joni Mitchell
Words like when you're older must appease him,Joni Mitchell
And promises of someday make his dreams,Joni Mitchell
And the seasons they go round and round,Joni Mitchell
And the painted ponies go up and down,Joni Mitchell
We're captive on the carousel of time,Joni Mitchell
We can't return we can only look behind,Joni Mitchell
From where we came,Joni Mitchell
And go round and round and round,Joni Mitchell
In the circle game Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now,Joni Mitchell
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town,Joni Mitchell
And they tell him,Joni Mitchell
Take your time it won't be long now,Joni Mitchell
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down,Joni Mitchell
And the seasons they go round and round,Joni Mitchell
And the painted ponies go up and down,Joni Mitchell
We're captive on the carousel of time,Joni Mitchell
We can't return we can only look behind,Joni Mitchell
From where we came,Joni Mitchell
And go round and round and round,Joni Mitchell
In the circle game So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty,Joni Mitchell
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true,Joni Mitchell
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty,Joni Mitchell
Before the last revolving year is through,Joni Mitchell
And the seasons they go round and round,Joni Mitchell
And the painted ponies go up and down,Joni Mitchell
We're captive on the carousel of time,Joni Mitchell
We can't return we can only look behind,Joni Mitchell
From where we came,Joni Mitchell
And go round and round and round,Joni Mitchell
In the circle game And go round and round and round,Joni Mitchell
In the circle game Just before our love got lost you said,Joni Mitchell
Well there's a wide wide world of noble causes,Joni Mitchell
And lovely landscapes to discover,Joni Mitchell
But all I really want right now,Joni Mitchell
Is find another lover When we were kids in Maidstone Sharon,Joni Mitchell
I went to every wedding in that little town,Joni Mitchell
To see the tears and the kisses,Joni Mitchell
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown,Joni Mitchell
And walking home on the railroad tracks,Joni Mitchell
Or swinging on the playground swing,Joni Mitchell
Love stimulated my illusions,Joni Mitchell
More than anything And when I went skating after Golden Reggie,Joni Mitchell
You know it was white lace I was chasing,Joni Mitchell
Chasing dreams,Joni Mitchell
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans,Joni Mitchell
He showed me first you get the kisses,Joni Mitchell
And then you get the tears,Joni Mitchell
But the ceremony of the bells and lace,Joni Mitchell
Still veils this reckless fool here Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink,Joni Mitchell
Circling in singles and in pairs,Joni Mitchell
In this vigorous anonymity,Joni Mitchell
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares,Joni Mitchell
And the power of reason,Joni Mitchell
And the flowers of deep feeling,Joni Mitchell
Seem to serve me,Joni Mitchell
Only to deceive me Sharon you've got a husband,Joni Mitchell
And a family and a farm,Joni Mitchell
I've got the apple of temptation,Joni Mitchell
And a diamond snake around my arm,Joni Mitchell
But you still have your music,Joni Mitchell
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky,Joni Mitchell
You sing for your friends and your family,Joni Mitchell
I'll walk green pastures by and by Again and again the same situation,Joni Mitchell
For so many years,Joni Mitchell
Tethered to a ringing telephone,Joni Mitchell
In a room full to mirrors,Joni Mitchell
A pretty girl in your bathroom,Joni Mitchell
Checking out her sex appeal,Joni Mitchell
I asked myself when you said you loved me,Joni Mitchell
Do you think this can be real? Still I sent up my prayer,Joni Mitchell
Wondering where it had to go,Joni Mitchell
With heaven full of astronauts,Joni Mitchell
And the Lord on death row,Joni Mitchell
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones,Joni Mitchell
Call out and glamour to be found,Joni Mitchell
Caught in their struggle for higher positions,Joni Mitchell
And their search for love that sticks around You've had lots of lovely women,Joni Mitchell
Now you turn your gaze to me,Joni Mitchell
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection,Joni Mitchell
To see if I'm worthy,Joni Mitchell
Like the church,Joni Mitchell
Like a cop,Joni Mitchell
Like a mother,Joni Mitchell
You want me to be truthful,Joni Mitchell
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though,Joni Mitchell
And I need your approval Still I sent up my prayer,Joni Mitchell
Wondering who was there to hear,Joni Mitchell
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones,Joni Mitchell
I called out to be released,Joni Mitchell
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements,Joni Mitchell
And my search for love,Joni Mitchell
That don't seem to cease Look out the left the captain said,Joni Mitchell
The lights down there that's where we'll land,Joni Mitchell
I saw a falling star burn up,Joni Mitchell
Above the Las Vegas sands,Joni Mitchell
It wasn't the one that you gave to me,Joni Mitchell
That night down south between the trailers,Joni Mitchell
Not the early one,Joni Mitchell
That you can wish upon,Joni Mitchell
Not the northern one,Joni Mitchell
That guides in the sailors Oh star bright star bright,Joni Mitchell
You've got the lovin' that I like all right,Joni Mitchell
Turn this crazy bird around,Joni Mitchell
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight You got the touch so gentle and sweet,Joni Mitchell
But you've got that look so critical,Joni Mitchell
Now I can't talk to you baby,Joni Mitchell
I get so weak,Joni Mitchell
Sometimes I think love is just mythical,Joni Mitchell
Up there's a heaven,Joni Mitchell
Down there's a town,Joni Mitchell
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine,Joni Mitchell
Oh blackness blackness dragging me down,Joni Mitchell
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine Oh star bright star bright,Joni Mitchell
You've got the lovin' that I like all right,Joni Mitchell
Turn this crazy bird around,Joni Mitchell
I shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight I'm drinking sweet champagne,Joni Mitchell
Got the headphones up high,Joni Mitchell
Can't numb you out,Joni Mitchell
Can't drum you out of my mind,Joni Mitchell
They're playing Goodbye baby Baby Goodbye,Joni Mitchell
Ooh ooh love is blind Up go the flaps down go the wheels,Joni Mitchell
I hope you got your heat turned on baby,Joni Mitchell
I hope they finally fixed your automobile,Joni Mitchell
I hope it's better when we meet again baby Star bright star bright,Joni Mitchell
You got the lovin' that I like all right,Joni Mitchell
Turn this crazy bird around,Joni Mitchell
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight There's a man who's been out sailing,Joni Mitchell
In a decade full of dreams,Joni Mitchell
And he takes her to a schooner,Joni Mitchell
And he treats her like a queen,Joni Mitchell
Bearing beads from California,Joni Mitchell
With their amber stones and green,Joni Mitchell
He has called her from the harbor,Joni Mitchell
He has kissed her with his freedom,Joni Mitchell
He has heard her off to starboard,Joni Mitchell
In the breaking and the breathing,Joni Mitchell
Of the water weeds,Joni Mitchell
While she was busy being free There's a man who's climbed a mountain,Joni Mitchell
And he's calling out her name,Joni Mitchell
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles,Joni Mitchell
He calls again,Joni Mitchell
He can think her there beside him,Joni Mitchell
He can miss her just the same,Joni Mitchell
He has missed her in the forest,Joni Mitchell
While he showed her all the flowers,Joni Mitchell
As he climbed the scaley towers,Joni Mitchell
Of a forest tree,Joni Mitchell
While she was somewhere being free There's a man who's sent a letter,Joni Mitchell
And he's waiting for reply,Joni Mitchell
He has asked her of her travels,Joni Mitchell
Since the day they said goodbye,Joni Mitchell
He has seen her at the office,Joni Mitchell
With her name on all his papers,Joni Mitchell
Through the sharing of the profits,Joni Mitchell
He will find it hard to shake her,Joni Mitchell
From his memory,Joni Mitchell
And she's so busy being free There's a lady in the city,Joni Mitchell
And she thinks she loves them all,Joni Mitchell
There's the one who's thinking of her,Joni Mitchell
There's the one who sometimes calls,Joni Mitchell
There's the one who writes her letters,Joni Mitchell
With his facts and figures scrawl,Joni Mitchell
She has brought them to her senses,Joni Mitchell
They have laughed inside her laughter,Joni Mitchell
Now she rallies her defenses,Joni Mitchell
For she fears that one will ask her,Joni Mitchell
For eternity,Joni Mitchell
And she's so busy being free There's a man who sends her medals,Joni Mitchell
He is bleeding from the war,Joni Mitchell
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store,Joni Mitchell
There's a drummer and a dreamer,Joni Mitchell
And you know there may be more,Joni Mitchell
She will love them when she sees them,Joni Mitchell
They will lose her if they follow,Joni Mitchell
And she only means to please them,Joni Mitchell
And her heart is full and hollow,Joni Mitchell
Like a cactus tree,Joni Mitchell
While she's so busy being free I pulled up behind a Cadillac,Joni Mitchell
We were waiting for the light,Joni Mitchell
And I took a look at his license plate,Joni Mitchell
It said Just Ice,Joni Mitchell
Is justice just ice?,Joni Mitchell
Governed by greed and lust?,Joni Mitchell
Just the strong doing what they can,Joni Mitchell
And the weak suffering what they must?,Joni Mitchell
Oh and the gas leaks,Joni Mitchell
And the oil spills,Joni Mitchell
And sex sells everything,Joni Mitchell
Sex kills Doctors' pills give you brand new ills,Joni Mitchell
And the bills bury you like an avalanche,Joni Mitchell
And lawyers haven't been this popular,Joni Mitchell
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France!,Joni Mitchell
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know,Joni Mitchell
The balance is undone crazy ions,Joni Mitchell
You can feel it out in traffic,Joni Mitchell
Everyone hates everyone,Joni Mitchell
And the gas leaks,Joni Mitchell
And the oil spills,Joni Mitchell
And sex sells everything,Joni Mitchell
Sex kills All these jack-offs at the office,Joni Mitchell
The rapist in the pool,Joni Mitchell
Oh and the tragedies in the nurseries,Joni Mitchell
Little kids packin' guns to school,Joni Mitchell
The ulcerated ozone,Joni Mitchell
These tumors of the skin,Joni Mitchell
This hostile sun beating down on,Joni Mitchell
Massive mess we're in,Joni Mitchell
And the gas leaks,Joni Mitchell
And the oil spills,Joni Mitchell
And sex sells everything,Joni Mitchell
And sex kills,Joni Mitchell
Sex kills,Joni Mitchell
Sex kills,Joni Mitchell
Oh sex kills,Joni Mitchell
Sex kills He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel,Joni Mitchell
He was drinking for diversion,Joni Mitchell
He was thinking for himself,Joni Mitchell
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs,Joni Mitchell
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves,Joni Mitchell
She says let me sit down,Joni Mitchell
Look at those jokers,Joni Mitchell
Glued to that damn hockey game,Joni Mitchell

They were pushing through a four lane highway,Joni Mitchell
Government gave us three thousand dollars,Joni Mitchell
You should have seen it fly away,Joni Mitchell
First he bought a '57 Biscayne,Joni Mitchell
He put it in the ditch,Joni Mitchell
He drunk up all the rest,Joni Mitchell
That son of a bitch,Joni Mitchell
His blood's bad whiskey,Joni Mitchell

Saying you are welcome back,Joni Mitchell
She is another canyon lady Estrella circus girl,Joni Mitchell
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls,Joni Mitchell
Songs like tiny hammers hurled,Joni Mitchell
At beveled mirrors in empty halls,Joni Mitchell
Empty halls and beveled mirrors,Joni Mitchell
Sailing seas and climbing banyans,Joni Mitchell
Come out for a visit here,Joni Mitchell
To be a lady of the canyon Trina takes her paints and her threads,Joni Mitchell

Coloring the sunshine hours,Joni Mitchell
They are the ladies of the canyon The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68,Joni Mitchell
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday,Joni Mitchell
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe,Joni Mitchell
You laugh he said you think you're immune go look at your eyes,Joni Mitchell
They're full of moon,Joni Mitchell
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you,Joni Mitchell
All those pretty lies pretty lies,Joni Mitchell
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies,Joni Mitchell
Only pretty lies just pretty lies He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer and he pushed,Joni Mitchell
Three buttons and the thing began to whirr,Joni Mitchell
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie,Joni Mitchell
And she said drink up now it's gettin' on time to close,Joni Mitchell
Richard you haven't really changed I said,Joni Mitchell
It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head,Joni Mitchell
You got tombs in your eyes but the songs,Joni Mitchell
You punched are dreaming,Joni Mitchell
Listen they sing of love so sweet love so sweet,Joni Mitchell
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?,Joni Mitchell
Oh and love can be so sweet love so sweet Richard got married to a figure skater,Joni Mitchell
And he bought her a dishwasher and a Coffee percolator,Joni Mitchell
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on,Joni Mitchell
And all the house lights left up bright,Joni Mitchell
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out,Joni Mitchell
I don't want Nobody comin' over to my table,Joni Mitchell
I got nothing to talk to anybody about,Joni Mitchell
All good dreamers pass this way some day,Joni Mitchell
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafes,Joni Mitchell
Dark cafes,Joni Mitchell
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings,Joni Mitchell
And fly away,Joni Mitchell
Only a phase these dark cafe days When Charlie speaks of Lester,Joni Mitchell
You know someone great has gone,Joni Mitchell
The sweetest swinging music man,Joni Mitchell
Had a Porkie Pig hat on,Joni Mitchell
A bright star,Joni Mitchell
In a dark age,Joni Mitchell
When the bandstands had a thousand ways,Joni Mitchell
Of refusing a black man admission,Joni Mitchell
Black musician,Joni Mitchell
In those days they put him in an,Joni Mitchell
Underdog position,Joni Mitchell
Cellars and chittlins' When Lester took him a wife,Joni Mitchell
Arm and arm went black and white,Joni Mitchell
And some saw red,Joni Mitchell
And drove them from their hotel bed,Joni Mitchell
Love is never easy,Joni Mitchell
It's short of the hope we have for happiness,Joni Mitchell
Bright and sweet,Joni Mitchell
Love is never easy street!,Joni Mitchell
Now we are black and white,Joni Mitchell
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night,Joni Mitchell
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town,Joni Mitchell
Or be hung in a tree,Joni Mitchell
That's unlikely! Tonight these crowds,Joni Mitchell
Are happy and loud,Joni Mitchell
Children are up dancing in the streets,Joni Mitchell
In the sticky middle of the night,Joni Mitchell
Summer serenade,Joni Mitchell
Of taxi horns and fun arcades,Joni Mitchell
Where right or wrong,Joni Mitchell
Under neon,Joni Mitchell
Every feeling goes on!,Joni Mitchell
For you and me,Joni Mitchell
The sidewalk is a history book,Joni Mitchell
And a circus,Joni Mitchell
Dangerous clowns,Joni Mitchell
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions,Joni Mitchell
They have been handed,Joni Mitchell
Day by day,Joni Mitchell
Generations on down We came up from the subway,Joni Mitchell
On the music midnight makes,Joni Mitchell
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone,Joni Mitchell
In taxi horns and brakes,Joni Mitchell
Now Charlie's down in Mexico,Joni Mitchell
With the healers,Joni Mitchell
So the sidewalk leads us with music,Joni Mitchell
To two little dancers,Joni Mitchell
Dancing outside a black bar,Joni Mitchell
There's a sign up on the awning,Joni Mitchell
It says Pork Pie Hat Bar,Joni Mitchell
And there's black babies dancing,Joni Mitchell
Tonight! Don't interrupt the sorrow,Joni Mitchell
Darn right,Joni Mitchell
In flames our prophet witches,Joni Mitchell
Be polite,Joni Mitchell
A room full of glasses,Joni Mitchell
He says Your notches liberation doll,Joni Mitchell
And he chains me with that serpent,Joni Mitchell
To that Ethiopian wall Anima rising,Joni Mitchell
Queen of Queens,Joni Mitchell
Wash my guilt of Eden,Joni Mitchell
Wash and balance me,Joni Mitchell
Anima rising,Joni Mitchell
Uprising in me tonight,Joni Mitchell
She's a vengeful little goddess,Joni Mitchell
With an ancient crown to fight Truth goes up in vapors,Joni Mitchell
The steeples lean,Joni Mitchell
Winds of change patriarchs,Joni Mitchell
Snug in your bible belt dreams,Joni Mitchell
God goes up the chimney,Joni Mitchell
Like childhood Santa Claus,Joni Mitchell
The good slaves love the good book,Joni Mitchell
A rebel loves a cause I'm leaving on the 115,Joni Mitchell
You're darn right,Joni Mitchell
Since I was seventeen,Joni Mitchell
I've had no one over me,Joni Mitchell
Darn right,Joni Mitchell
Don't let up the sorrow,Joni Mitchell
Death and birth and death and birth,Joni Mitchell
Rhine wine,Joni Mitchell
Milk of the Madonna,Joni Mitchell
Clandestine,Joni Mitchell
He don't let up the sorrow,Joni Mitchell
He lies and he cheats,Joni Mitchell
It takes a heart like Mary's these days,Joni Mitchell
When your man gets weak Varnished weeds in window jars,Joni Mitchell
Tarnished beads on tapestries,Joni Mitchell
Kept in satin boxes are,Joni Mitchell
Reflections of love's memories Letters from across the seas,Joni Mitchell
Roses dipped in sealing wax,Joni Mitchell
Valentines and maple leaves,Joni Mitchell
Tucked into a paperback Guess I'll throw them all away,Joni Mitchell
I found someone to love today Dark with darker moods is he,Joni Mitchell
Not a golden Prince who's come,Joni Mitchell
Through columbines and wizardry,Joni Mitchell
To talk of castles in the sun Still I'll take a chance and see,Joni Mitchell
I found someone to love today There's a sorrow in his eyes,Joni Mitchell
Like the angel made of tin,Joni Mitchell
What will happen if I try,Joni Mitchell
To place another heart in him In a Bleeker Street cafe,Joni Mitchell
I found someone to love today,Joni Mitchell
I found someone to love today I am a woman of heart and mind,Joni Mitchell
With time on her hands,Joni Mitchell
No child to raise,Joni Mitchell
You come to me like a little boy,Joni Mitchell
And I give you my scorn and my praise,Joni Mitchell
You think I'm like your mother,Joni Mitchell
Or another lover or your sister,Joni Mitchell
Or the queen of your dreams,Joni Mitchell
Or just another silly girl,Joni Mitchell
When love makes a fool of me After the rush when you come back down,Joni Mitchell
You're always disappointed,Joni Mitchell
Nothing seems to keep you high,Joni Mitchell
Drive your bargains,Joni Mitchell
Push your papers,Joni Mitchell
Win your medals,Joni Mitchell
Fuck your strangers,Joni Mitchell
Don't it leave you on the empty side,Joni Mitchell
I'm looking for affection and respect,Joni Mitchell
A little passion,Joni Mitchell
And you want stimulation-nothing more,Joni Mitchell
That's what I think,Joni Mitchell
But you know I'll try to be there for you,Joni Mitchell
When your spirits start to sink All this talk about holiness now,Joni Mitchell
It must be the start of the latest style,Joni Mitchell
Is it all books and words,Joni Mitchell
Or do you really feel it?,Joni Mitchell
Do you really laugh?,Joni Mitchell
Do you really care?,Joni Mitchell
Do you really smile,Joni Mitchell
When you smile?,Joni Mitchell
You criticize and you flatter,Joni Mitchell
You imitate the best,Joni Mitchell
And the rest you memorize,Joni Mitchell
You know the times you impress me most,Joni Mitchell
Are the times when you don't try,Joni Mitchell
When you don't even try A strange boy is weaving,Joni Mitchell
A course of grace and havoc,Joni Mitchell
On a yellow skateboard,Joni Mitchell
Through midday sidewalk traffic,Joni Mitchell
Just when I think he's foolish and childish,Joni Mitchell
And I want him to be manly,Joni Mitchell
I catch my fool and my child,Joni Mitchell
Needing love and understanding What a strange strange boy,Joni Mitchell
He still lives with his family,Joni Mitchell
Even the war and the navy,Joni Mitchell
Couldn't bring him to maturity He keeps referring back to school days,Joni Mitchell
And clinging to his child,Joni Mitchell
Fidgeting and bullied,Joni Mitchell
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild,Joni Mitchell
He asked me to be patient,Joni Mitchell
Well I failed,Joni Mitchell
Grow up! I cried,Joni Mitchell
And as the smoke was clearing he said,Joni Mitchell
Give me one good reason why! What a strange strange boy,Joni Mitchell
He sees the cars as sets of waves,Joni Mitchell
Sequences of mass and space,Joni Mitchell
He sees the damage in my face We got high on travel,Joni Mitchell
And we got drunk on alcohol,Joni Mitchell
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all,Joni Mitchell
See how that feeling comes and goes,Joni Mitchell
Like the pull of moon on tides,Joni Mitchell
Now I am surf rising,Joni Mitchell
Now parched ribs of sand at his side What a strange strange boy,Joni Mitchell
I gave him clothes and jewelry,Joni Mitchell
I gave him my warm body,Joni Mitchell
I gave him power over me A thousand glass eyes were staring,Joni Mitchell
In a cellar full of antique dolls,Joni Mitchell
I found an old piano,Joni Mitchell
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls,Joni Mitchell
While the boarders were snoring,Joni Mitchell
Under crisp white sheets of curfew,Joni Mitchell
We were newly lovers then,Joni Mitchell
We were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter,Joni Mitchell
I came out two days on your tail,Joni Mitchell
Those two bald-headed days in November,Joni Mitchell
Before the first snowflakes sail,Joni Mitchell
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery,Joni Mitchell
A split tongue spirit talks,Joni Mitchell
Noble as a nickel chief,Joni Mitchell
Striking up an old juke box,Joni Mitchell
And he says,Joni Mitchell
Snakes along the railroad tracks.,Joni Mitchell
He says Eagles in jet trails,Joni Mitchell
He says Wind in the Wings,Joni Mitchell
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!,Joni Mitchell
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas,Joni Mitchell
Reran on channel five,Joni Mitchell
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul,Joni Mitchell
I nearly broke down and cried,Joni Mitchell
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me,Joni Mitchell
He says Your serpent cannot be denied.,Joni Mitchell
Our serpents love the whisky bars,Joni Mitchell
They love the romance of the crime,Joni Mitchell
But didn't I see a neon sign,Joni Mitchell
Fester on your hotel blind,Joni Mitchell
And a country road come off the wall,Joni Mitchell
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar,Joni Mitchell
And put me at the top of your danger list,Joni Mitchell
Just for being so much like you are! You're a coward against the altitude,Joni Mitchell
You're a coward against the flesh,Joni Mitchell
Coward caught between yes and no,Joni Mitchell
Reckless this time on the line for yes yes yes!,Joni Mitchell
Reckless brazen in the play,Joni Mitchell
Of your changing traffic lights,Joni Mitchell
Coward slinking down the hall,Joni Mitchell
to another restless night,Joni Mitchell
As we center behind the eight ball,Joni Mitchell
As we rock between the sheets,Joni Mitchell
As we siphon the colored language,Joni Mitchell
Off the farms and the streets,Joni Mitchell
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America,Joni Mitchell
the home of the brave and the free,Joni Mitchell
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards,Joni Mitchell
Of some duality,Joni Mitchell
Of restless multiplicity,Joni Mitchell
Restless for home and routine,Joni Mitchell
Restless for country-safety-and her,Joni Mitchell
Restless for the likes of reckless me,Joni Mitchell
Restless sweeps like fire and rain,Joni Mitchell
Over virgin wilderness,Joni Mitchell
It prowls like hookers and thieves,Joni Mitchell
Through bolt locked tenements,Joni Mitchell
Behind my bolt locked door,Joni Mitchell
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me,Joni Mitchell
The serpent fighting for blind desire,Joni Mitchell
The eagle for clarity,Joni Mitchell
What strange prizes these battles bring,Joni Mitchell
These hectic joys-these weary blues,Joni Mitchell
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win,Joni Mitchell
Down and shaken when I think I lose,Joni Mitchell
There are rivets up here in this eagle,Joni Mitchell
There are box cars down there on your snake,Joni Mitchell
And we are twins of spirit,Joni Mitchell
No matter which route home we take,Joni Mitchell
Or what we forsake,Joni Mitchell
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity,Joni Mitchell
And we'll go down to the beads of guile,Joni Mitchell
There is danger and education,Joni Mitchell
In living out such a reckless life style,Joni Mitchell
I touched you on the central plains,Joni Mitchell
It was plane to train my twin,Joni Mitchell
It was just plane shadow to train shadow,Joni Mitchell
But to me it was skin to skin,Joni Mitchell
The spirit talks in spectrums,Joni Mitchell
He talks to mother earth to father sky,Joni Mitchell
Self indulgence to self denial,Joni Mitchell
Man to woman,Joni Mitchell
Scales to feathers,Joni Mitchell
You and I,Joni Mitchell
Eagles in the sky,Joni Mitchell
You and I,Joni Mitchell
Snakes in the grass,Joni Mitchell
You and I,Joni Mitchell
Crawl and fly,Joni Mitchell
You and I Words and music by,Joni Mitchell
May your dreams come true,Joni Mitchell
May old father time,Joni Mitchell
Never be unkind,Joni Mitchell
And through the years,Joni Mitchell
Save your smiles and your tears,Joni Mitchell
They're just souvenirs,Joni Mitchell
They'll make music in your heart,Joni Mitchell
Remember this,Joni Mitchell
Each new day is a kiss,Joni Mitchell
Sent from up above,Joni Mitchell
With an angel's love,Joni Mitchell
So here's to you,Joni Mitchell
May your skies be blue,Joni Mitchell
And your love blessed,Joni Mitchell
That's my best to you Remember this,Joni Mitchell
Each new day is a kiss,Joni Mitchell
Sent from up above,Joni Mitchell
With an angel's love,Joni Mitchell
So here's to you,Joni Mitchell
May your skies be blue,Joni Mitchell
And your love blessed,Joni Mitchell
That's my very best to you Everything comes and goes,Joni Mitchell
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes,Joni Mitchell
Things that you held high,Joni Mitchell
And told yourself were true,Joni Mitchell
Lost or changing as the days come down to you,Joni Mitchell
Down to you,Joni Mitchell
Constant stranger,Joni Mitchell
You're a kind person,Joni Mitchell
You're a cold person too,Joni Mitchell
It's down to you You go down to the pick up station,Joni Mitchell
Craving warmth and beauty,Joni Mitchell
You settle for less than fascination,Joni Mitchell
A few drinks later you're not so choosy,Joni Mitchell
When the closing lights strip off the shadows,Joni Mitchell
On this strange new flesh you've found,Joni Mitchell
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf,Joni Mitchell
You hurry,Joni Mitchell
To the blackness,Joni Mitchell
And the blankets,Joni Mitchell
To lay down an impression,Joni Mitchell
And your loneliness In the morning there are lovers in the street,Joni Mitchell
They look so high,Joni Mitchell
You brush against a stranger,Joni Mitchell
And you both apologize,Joni Mitchell
Old friends seem indifferent,Joni Mitchell
You must have brought that on,Joni Mitchell
Old bonds have broken down,Joni Mitchell
Love is gone,Joni Mitchell
Ooh love is gone,Joni Mitchell
Written on your spirit this sad song,Joni Mitchell
Love is gone Everything comes and goes,Joni Mitchell
Pleasure moves on too early,Joni Mitchell
And trouble leaves too slow,Joni Mitchell
Just when you're thinking,Joni Mitchell
You've finally got it made,Joni Mitchell
Bad news comes knocking,Joni Mitchell
At your garden gate,Joni Mitchell
Knocking for you,Joni Mitchell
Constant stranger,Joni Mitchell
You're a brute you're an angel,Joni Mitchell
You can crawl you can fly too,Joni Mitchell
It's down to you,Joni Mitchell
It all comes down to you I awoke today and found the frost perched on the town,Joni Mitchell
It hovered in a frozen sky then it gobbled summer down,Joni Mitchell
When the sun turns traitor cold,Joni Mitchell
and all trees are shivering in a naked row,Joni Mitchell
I get the urge for going but I never seem to go,Joni Mitchell
I get the urge for going,Joni Mitchell
When the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in,Joni Mitchell
I had me a man in summertime,Joni Mitchell
He had summer-colored skin,Joni Mitchell
And not another girl in town,Joni Mitchell
My darling's heart could win,Joni Mitchell
But when the leaves fell on the ground,Joni Mitchell
And bully winds came around pushed them face down in the snow,Joni Mitchell
He got the urge for going and I had to let him go,Joni Mitchell
He got the urge for going,Joni Mitchell
When the meadow grass was turning brown And summertime was falling down and winter was closing in,Joni Mitchell
Now the warriors of winter they gave a cold triumphant shout,Joni Mitchell
And all that stays is dying and all that lives is getting out,Joni Mitchell
See the geese in chevron flight flapping and racing on before the snow,Joni Mitchell
They've got the urge for going and they've got the wings so they can go,Joni Mitchell
They get the urge for going,Joni Mitchell
When the meadow grass is turning brown Summertime is falling down and winter is closing in,Joni Mitchell
I'll ply the fire with kindling and pull the blankets to my chin,Joni Mitchell
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and I'll bolt my wandering in,Joni Mitchell
I'd like to call back summertime and have her stay for just another month or so,Joni Mitchell
But she's got the urge for going so I guess she'll have to go,Joni Mitchell
She get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown,Joni Mitchell
And all her empires are falling down,Joni Mitchell
And winter's closing in,Joni Mitchell
And I get the urge for going when the meadow grass is turning brown,Joni Mitchell
And summertime is falling down The story hit the news,Joni Mitchell
From coast to coast,Joni Mitchell
They said you beat the girl,Joni Mitchell
You loved the most,Joni Mitchell
Your charitable acts,Joni Mitchell
Seemed out of place,Joni Mitchell
With the beauty,Joni Mitchell
With your fist marks on her face,Joni Mitchell
Your buddies all stood by,Joni Mitchell
They bet their,Joni Mitchell
Fortunes and their fame,Joni Mitchell
That she was out of line,Joni Mitchell
And you were not to blame Six hundred thousand doctors,Joni Mitchell
Are putting on rubber gloves,Joni Mitchell
And they're poking,Joni Mitchell
At the miseries made of love,Joni Mitchell
They say they're learning,Joni Mitchell
How to spot,Joni Mitchell
The battered wives,Joni Mitchell
Among all the women,Joni Mitchell
They see bleeding through their lives,Joni Mitchell
I bleed,Joni Mitchell
For your perversity,Joni Mitchell
These red words that make a stain,Joni Mitchell
On your white-washed claim that,Joni Mitchell
She was out of line,Joni Mitchell
And you were not to blame I heard your baby say,Joni Mitchell
When he was only three,Joni Mitchell
His mother had the frailty,Joni Mitchell
You despise,Joni Mitchell
And the looks you love,Joni Mitchell
To drive to suicide,Joni Mitchell
Not one wet eye around her,Joni Mitchell
Lonely little grave,Joni Mitchell
The merchants roll their awnings down,Joni Mitchell
The milktrucks make their morning rounds,Joni Mitchell
In morning Morgantown We'll rise up early with the sun,Joni Mitchell
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning,Joni Mitchell
And the day is young,Joni Mitchell
In morning Morgantown Morning Morgantown,Joni Mitchell
Buy your dreams a dollar down,Joni Mitchell
Morning any town you name,Joni Mitchell
Morning's just the same We'll find a table in the shade,Joni Mitchell
And sip our tea and lemonade,Joni Mitchell
And watch the morning on parade,Joni Mitchell
In morning Morgantown Ladies in their rainbow fashions,Joni Mitchell
Colored stop and go lights flashing,Joni Mitchell
We'll wink at total strangers passing in,Joni Mitchell
Morning Morgantown Morning Morgantown,Joni Mitchell
Buy your dreams a dollar down,Joni Mitchell
Morning any town you name,Joni Mitchell
Morning's just the same I'd like to buy you everything,Joni Mitchell
A wooden bird with painted wings,Joni Mitchell
A window full of colored rings,Joni Mitchell
In morning Morgantown But the only thing I have to give,Joni Mitchell
To make you smile to win you with,Joni Mitchell
Are all the mornings still to live,Joni Mitchell
In morning Morgantown Morning Morgantown,Joni Mitchell
Buy your dreams a dollar down,Joni Mitchell
Morning any town you name,Joni Mitchell
Morning's just the same Morning's just the same All the people at this party,Joni Mitchell
They've got a lot of style,Joni Mitchell
They've got stamps of many countries,Joni Mitchell
They've got passport smiles,Joni Mitchell
Some are friendly,Joni Mitchell
Some are cutting,Joni Mitchell
Some are watching it from the wings,Joni Mitchell
Some are standing in the centre,Joni Mitchell
Giving to get something Photo Beauty gets attention,Joni Mitchell
Then her eye paint's running down,Joni Mitchell
She's got a rose in her teeth,Joni Mitchell
And a lampshade crown,Joni Mitchell
One minute she's so happy,Joni Mitchell
Then she's crying on someone's knee,Joni Mitchell
Saying laughing and crying,Joni Mitchell
You know it's the same release I told you when I met you,Joni Mitchell
I was crazy,Joni Mitchell
Cry for us all Beauty,Joni Mitchell
Cry for Eddie in the corner,Joni Mitchell
Thinking he's nobody,Joni Mitchell
And Jack behind his joker,Joni Mitchell
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan,Joni Mitchell
And me in my frightened silence,Joni Mitchell
Thinking I don't understand I feel like I'm sleeping,Joni Mitchell
Can you wake me?,Joni Mitchell
You seem to have a broader sensibility,Joni Mitchell
I'm just living on nerves and feelings,Joni Mitchell
With a weak and a lazy mind,Joni Mitchell
And coming to people's parties,Joni Mitchell
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind I wish I had more sense of humor,Joni Mitchell
Keeping the sadness at bay,Joni Mitchell
Throwing the lightness on these things,Joni Mitchell
Laughing it all away,Joni Mitchell
Laughing it all away,Joni Mitchell
Laughing it all away I met a friend of spirit,Joni Mitchell
He drank and womanized,Joni Mitchell
And I sat before his sanity,Joni Mitchell
I was holding back from crying,Joni Mitchell
He saw my complications,Joni Mitchell
And he mirrored me back simplified,Joni Mitchell
And we laughed how our perfection,Joni Mitchell
Would always be denied,Joni Mitchell
Heart and humor and humility,Joni Mitchell
He said Will lighten up your heavy load,Joni Mitchell
I left him for the refuge of the roads I fell in with some drifters,Joni Mitchell
Cast upon a beach town,Joni Mitchell
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs,Joni Mitchell
And I wound up fixing dinner,Joni Mitchell
For them and Boston Jim,Joni Mitchell
I well up with affection,Joni Mitchell
Thinking back down the roads to then,Joni Mitchell
The nets were overflowing,Joni Mitchell
In the Gulf of Mexico,Joni Mitchell
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads There was spring along the ditches,Joni Mitchell
There were good times in the cities,Joni Mitchell
Oh radiant happiness,Joni Mitchell
It was all so light and easy,Joni Mitchell
Till I started analyzing,Joni Mitchell
And I brought on my old ways,Joni Mitchell
A thunderhead of judgment was,Joni Mitchell
Gathering in my gaze,Joni Mitchell
And it made most people nervous,Joni Mitchell
They just didn't want to know,Joni Mitchell
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads I pulled off into a forest,Joni Mitchell
Crickets clicking in the ferns,Joni Mitchell
Like a wheel of fortune,Joni Mitchell
I heard my fate turn turn turn,Joni Mitchell
And I went running down a white sand road,Joni Mitchell
I was running like a white-assed deer,Joni Mitchell
Running to lose the blues,Joni Mitchell
To the innocence in here,Joni Mitchell
These are the clouds of Michelangelo,Joni Mitchell
Muscular with gods and sungold,Joni Mitchell
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads In a highway service station,Joni Mitchell
Over the month of June,Joni Mitchell
Was a photograph of the earth,Joni Mitchell
Taken coming back from the moon,Joni Mitchell
And you couldn't see a city,Joni Mitchell
On that marbled bowling ball,Joni Mitchell
Or a forest or a highway,Joni Mitchell
Or me here least of all,Joni Mitchell
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms,Joni Mitchell
Or this baggage overload,Joni Mitchell
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads Turning and turning,Joni Mitchell
Within the widening gyre,Joni Mitchell
The falcon cannot hear the falconer,Joni Mitchell
Things fall apart,Joni Mitchell
The center cannot hold,Joni Mitchell
And a blood dimmed tide,Joni Mitchell
Is loosed upon the world Nothing is sacred,Joni Mitchell
The ceremony sinks,Joni Mitchell
Innocence is drowned,Joni Mitchell
In anarchy,Joni Mitchell
The best lack conviction,Joni Mitchell
Given some time to think,Joni Mitchell
And the worst are full of passion,Joni Mitchell
Without mercy Surely some revelation is at hand,Joni Mitchell
Surely it's the second coming,Joni Mitchell
And the wrath has finally taken form,Joni Mitchell
For what is this rough beast,Joni Mitchell
Its hour come at last,Joni Mitchell
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born,Joni Mitchell
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born Hoping and hoping,Joni Mitchell
As if by my weak faith,Joni Mitchell
The spirit of this world,Joni Mitchell
Would heal and rise,Joni Mitchell
Vast are the shadows,Joni Mitchell
That straddle and strafe,Joni Mitchell
And struggle in the darkness,Joni Mitchell
Troubling my eyes Shaped like a lion,Joni Mitchell
It has the head of a man,Joni Mitchell
With a gaze as blank,Joni Mitchell
And pitiless as the sun,Joni Mitchell
And it's moving its slow thighs,Joni Mitchell
Across the desert sands,Joni Mitchell
Through dark indignant,Joni Mitchell
Reeling falcons Surely some revelation is at hand,Joni Mitchell
Surely it's the second coming,Joni Mitchell
And the wrath has finally taken form,Joni Mitchell
For what is this rough beast,Joni Mitchell
Its hour come at last,Joni Mitchell
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born,Joni Mitchell
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born Raging and raging,Joni Mitchell
It rises from the deep,Joni Mitchell
Opening its eyes,Joni Mitchell
After twenty centuries,Joni Mitchell
Vexed to a nightmare,Joni Mitchell
Out of a stony sleep,Joni Mitchell
By a rocking cradle,Joni Mitchell
By the Sea of Galilee Surely some revelation is at hand,Joni Mitchell
Surely it's the second coming,Joni Mitchell
And the wrath has finally taken form,Joni Mitchell
For what is this rough beast,Joni Mitchell
Its hour come at last,Joni Mitchell
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born,Joni Mitchell
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born If there's one rule to this game,Joni Mitchell

Fire and ice Back in 1957,Joni Mitchell
We had to dance a foot apart,Joni Mitchell
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines,Joni Mitchell
Holding their rulers without a heart,Joni Mitchell
And so with just a touch of our fingers,Joni Mitchell
I could make our circuitry explode,Joni Mitchell
All we ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Oh come in from the cold,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold We really thought we had a purpose,Joni Mitchell
We were so anxious to achieve,Joni Mitchell
We had hope,Joni Mitchell
The world held promise,Joni Mitchell
For a slave to liberty,Joni Mitchell
Freely I slaved away for something better,Joni Mitchell
And I was bought and sold,Joni Mitchell
And all I ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold I feel your legs under the table,Joni Mitchell
Leaning into mine,Joni Mitchell
I feel renewed,Joni Mitchell
I feel disabled,Joni Mitchell
By these bonfires in my spine,Joni Mitchell
I don't know who the arsonist was,Joni Mitchell
Which incendiary soul,Joni Mitchell
But all I ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold I am not some stone commission,Joni Mitchell
Like a statue in a park,Joni Mitchell
I am flesh and blood and vision,Joni Mitchell
I am howling in the dark,Joni Mitchell
Long blue shadows of the jackals,Joni Mitchell
Are falling on a pay phone by the road,Joni Mitchell
Oh all they ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold Is this just vulgar electricity,Joni Mitchell
Is this the edifying fire,Joni Mitchell
Does your smile's covert complicity,Joni Mitchell
Debase as it admires,Joni Mitchell
Are you just checking out your mojo,Joni Mitchell
Or am I just fighting off growing old,Joni Mitchell
All I ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold I know we never will be perfect,Joni Mitchell
Never entirely clear,Joni Mitchell
We get hurt and we just panic,Joni Mitchell
And we strike out,Joni Mitchell
Out of fear,Joni Mitchell
I fear the sentence of this solitude,Joni Mitchell
Two hundred years on hold,Joni Mitchell
Oh and all we ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold When I thought life had some meaning,Joni Mitchell
Then I thought I had some choice,Joni Mitchell
And I made some value judgments,Joni Mitchell
In a self-important voice,Joni Mitchell
But then absurdity came over me,Joni Mitchell
And I longed to lose control,Joni Mitchell
Oh all I ever wanted,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold,Joni Mitchell
Oh come in come in,Joni Mitchell
Come in from the cold,Joni Mitchell
Come in come in,Joni Mitchell
Coming from the cold I am Lakota!,Joni Mitchell
Lakota!,Joni Mitchell
Looking at money man,Joni Mitchell
Diggin' the deadly quotas,Joni Mitchell
Out of balance,Joni Mitchell
Out of hand,Joni Mitchell
We want the land!,Joni Mitchell
Lay down the reeking ore!,Joni Mitchell
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?,Joni Mitchell
Everywhere you touch the earth she's sore,Joni Mitchell
Every time you skin her all things weep,Joni Mitchell
Your money mocks us,Joni Mitchell
Restitution what good can it do?,Joni Mitchell
Kenneled in metered boxes,Joni Mitchell
Red dogs in debt to you I am Lakota!,Joni Mitchell
Lakota!,Joni Mitchell
Fighting among ourselves,Joni Mitchell
All we can say with one whole heart,Joni Mitchell
Is we won't sell,Joni Mitchell
No we'll never sell,Joni Mitchell
We want the land!,Joni Mitchell
The lonely coyote calls,Joni Mitchell
In the woodlands footprints of the deer,Joni Mitchell
In the barrooms poor drunk bastard falls,Joni Mitchell
In the courtrooms deaf ears sixty years,Joni Mitchell
You think we're sleeping--but,Joni Mitchell
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars,Joni Mitchell
We have seen the trampled rainbows,Joni Mitchell
In the smoke of cars ,Joni Mitchell
I am Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Brave,Joni Mitchell
Sun pity me,Joni Mitchell
I am Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Broken,Joni Mitchell
Moon pity me,Joni Mitchell
I am Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Grave,Joni Mitchell
Shadows stretching,Joni Mitchell
Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Oh pity me,Joni Mitchell
I am Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Weak,Joni Mitchell
Grass pity me,Joni Mitchell
I am Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Faithful,Joni Mitchell
Rocks pity me,Joni Mitchell
I am Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Meek,Joni Mitchell
Standing water,Joni Mitchell
Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Oh pity me I am Lakota!,Joni Mitchell
Lakota!,Joni Mitchell
Standing on sacred land,Joni Mitchell
We never sold these Black Hills,Joni Mitchell
To the missile-heads,Joni Mitchell
To the power plants,Joni Mitchell
We want the land!,Joni Mitchell
The bullet and the fence broke Lakota,Joni Mitchell
The black coats and the booze broke Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Courts that circumvent choke Lakota,Joni Mitchell
Nothing left to lose,Joni Mitchell
Tell me grandfather,Joni Mitchell
You spoke the fur and feather tongues,Joni Mitchell
Do you hear the whimpering waters,Joni Mitchell
When the tractors come?  Sun pity me,Joni Mitchell
Mother earth,Joni Mitchell
Mother,Joni Mitchell
Moon pity me,Joni Mitchell
Father sky,Joni Mitchell
Father,Joni Mitchell
Shadows,Joni Mitchell
Stretching on the forest floor,Joni Mitchell
Mother earth,Joni Mitchell

Grass pity me,Joni Mitchell
Mother earth,Joni Mitchell
Mother,Joni Mitchell
Rocks pity me,Joni Mitchell
Father sky,Joni Mitchell
Father,Joni Mitchell
Water,Joni Mitchell
Standing in a waken manner,Joni Mitchell
Mother earth,Joni Mitchell
Oh pity me I heard it in the wind last night,Joni Mitchell
It sounded like applause,Joni Mitchell
Did you get a round resounding for you,Joni Mitchell
Way up here,Joni Mitchell
Seems like many dim years ago,Joni Mitchell
Since I heard that face to face,Joni Mitchell
So seen you face to face,Joni Mitchell
Though tonight I can feel you here,Joni Mitchell
I get these notes,Joni Mitchell
On butterflies and lilac sprays,Joni Mitchell
From girls who just have to tell me,Joni Mitchell
They saw you somewhere In some office sits a poet,Joni Mitchell
And he trembles as he sings,Joni Mitchell
And he asks some guy,Joni Mitchell
To circulate his soul around,Joni Mitchell
On your mark red ribbon runner,Joni Mitchell
The caressing rev of motors,Joni Mitchell
Finely tuned like fancy women,Joni Mitchell
In Thirties evening gowns,Joni Mitchell
Up the charts,Joni Mitchell
Off to the airport,Joni Mitchell
Your name's in the news,Joni Mitchell
Everything's first class,Joni Mitchell
The lights go down,Joni Mitchell
And it's just you up there,Joni Mitchell
Getting them to feel like that Remember the days when you used to sit,Joni Mitchell
And make up your tunes for love,Joni Mitchell
And pour your simple sorrow,Joni Mitchell
To the sound hole and your knee,Joni Mitchell
And now you're seen,Joni Mitchell
On giant screens,Joni Mitchell
And at parties for the press,Joni Mitchell
And for people who have slices of you,Joni Mitchell
From the company,Joni Mitchell
They toss around your latest golden egg,Joni Mitchell
Speculation-well who's to know,Joni Mitchell
If the next one in the nest,Joni Mitchell
Will glitter for them so I guess I seem ungrateful,Joni Mitchell
With my teeth sunk in the hand,Joni Mitchell
That brings me things,Joni Mitchell
I really can't give up just yet,Joni Mitchell
Now I sit up here,Joni Mitchell
The critic!,Joni Mitchell
And they introduce some band,Joni Mitchell
But they seem so much confetti,Joni Mitchell
Looking at them on my TV set,Joni Mitchell
Oh the power and the glory,Joni Mitchell
Just when you're getting a taste for worship,Joni Mitchell
They start bringing out the hammers,Joni Mitchell
And the boards,Joni Mitchell
And the nails I heard it in the wind last night,Joni Mitchell
It sounded like applause,Joni Mitchell
Chilly now,Joni Mitchell
End of summer,Joni Mitchell
No more shiny hot nights,Joni Mitchell
It was just the arbutus rustling,Joni Mitchell
And the bumping of the logs,Joni Mitchell
And the moon swept down black water,Joni Mitchell
Like an empty spotlight Once in a while,Joni Mitchell
In a big blue moon,Joni Mitchell
There comes a night like this,Joni Mitchell
Like some surrealist,Joni Mitchell
Invented this fourth of July,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home Hula girls,Joni Mitchell
And caterpillar tractors in the sand,Joni Mitchell
The ukulele man,Joni Mitchell
The fireworks,Joni Mitchell
This 4th of July,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home I love the man beside me,Joni Mitchell
We love the open road,Joni Mitchell
No phones till Friday,Joni Mitchell
Far from the overkill,Joni Mitchell
Far from the overload Back at the bar,Joni Mitchell
The band tears down,Joni Mitchell
But out here in the headlight beams,Joni Mitchell
The silver power lines,Joni Mitchell
Gleam,Joni Mitchell
On this fourth of July,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home Round the curve,Joni Mitchell
And a big dark horse,Joni Mitchell
Red taillights on his hide,Joni Mitchell
Is keeping right alongside,Joni Mitchell
Rev for stride,Joni Mitchell
Fourth of July,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home I love the man beside me,Joni Mitchell
We love the open road,Joni Mitchell
No phones till Friday,Joni Mitchell
Far from the undertow,Joni Mitchell
Far from the overload Once in awhile,Joni Mitchell
In a big blue moon,Joni Mitchell
There comes a night like this,Joni Mitchell
Like some surrealist,Joni Mitchell
Invented this fourth of July,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home,Joni Mitchell
On a night ride home,Joni Mitchell
On a night ride home,Joni Mitchell
Night ride home Although I speak in tongues,Joni Mitchell
Of men and angels,Joni Mitchell
I'm just sounding brass,Joni Mitchell
And tinkling cymbals without love- Love suffers long-,Joni Mitchell
Love is kind!-,Joni Mitchell
Enduring all things-,Joni Mitchell
Love has no evil in mind If I had the gift of prophecy-,Joni Mitchell
And all the knowledge-,Joni Mitchell
And the faith to move the mountains,Joni Mitchell
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-,Joni Mitchell
If I didn't have love,Joni Mitchell
I'd be nothing Love-never looks for love-,Joni Mitchell
Love's not puffed up-,Joni Mitchell
Or envious-,Joni Mitchell
Or touchy-,Joni Mitchell
Because it rejoices in the truth,Joni Mitchell
Not in iniquity,Joni Mitchell
Love sees like a child sees As a child I spoke as a child-,Joni Mitchell
I thought and I understood as a child-,Joni Mitchell
But when I became a woman-,Joni Mitchell
I put away childish things,Joni Mitchell
And began to see through a glass darkly Where as a child I saw it face to face,Joni Mitchell
Now I only know it in part,Joni Mitchell
Fractions in me,Joni Mitchell
Of faith and hope and love,Joni Mitchell
And of these great three,Joni Mitchell
Love's the greatest beauty,Joni Mitchell
Love,Joni Mitchell
Love,Joni Mitchell
Love I was in an all night movie,Joni Mitchell
When I heard the usher say,Joni Mitchell
Here comes the midnight cowboy,Joni Mitchell
Got his gun hired out for pay;,Joni Mitchell
You were walking kind of faded,Joni Mitchell
From the netherlands hotel,Joni Mitchell
With your hat tipped off to ladies,Joni Mitchell
Really looking well. Aw joe why don't you go back home?,Joni Mitchell
Really hate to see you falling down,Joni Mitchell
Get out of town. Well you came to new york city with a calendar full of gold,Joni Mitchell
Now they locked it up in the bedroom,Joni Mitchell
And they kicked you out in the cold;,Joni Mitchell
Now you can't afford a little blanket,Joni Mitchell
You can get one from a friend,Joni Mitchell
You can trick one off the corner,Joni Mitchell
You can even keep the change - to spend. Hey joe why don't you go back home?,Joni Mitchell
Really hate to see you come falling down,Joni Mitchell
Get out of town. There's a soldier in the depot,Joni Mitchell
He's a fighting nightingale,Joni Mitchell
Wearing western boots and buckskin on,Joni Mitchell
Reading fortunes from the penny scale;,Joni Mitchell
Now today he's got a a quarter,Joni Mitchell
For the photograph machine,Joni Mitchell
But tomorrow he'll be lonely lonely,Joni Mitchell
That's the way it's always been. Poor joe why don't you go back home?,Joni Mitchell
Really hate to see you falling down,Joni Mitchell
Get out of town. I was in an all night movie,Joni Mitchell
When I heard the usher say,Joni Mitchell
Here comes the midnight cowboy again,Joni Mitchell
Got his gun hired out for pay;,Joni Mitchell
You were walking kind of faded,Joni Mitchell
From the netherlands hotel,Joni Mitchell
Hat tipped off to ladies,Joni Mitchell
Tipped off to gentlemen as well. Well joe why don't you go back home?,Joni Mitchell
Find yourself a girl and settle down,Joni Mitchell
Get out of town,Joni Mitchell
Get out of town,Joni Mitchell
Find yourself a girl go and settle down,Joni Mitchell
Hey joe looking more lost than found,Joni Mitchell
Get out of town. I was an unmarried girl,Joni Mitchell
I'd just turned twenty-seven,Joni Mitchell
When they sent me to the sisters,Joni Mitchell
For the way men looked at me,Joni Mitchell
Branded as a Jezebel,Joni Mitchell
I knew I was not bound for Heaven,Joni Mitchell
I'd be cast in shame,Joni Mitchell
Into the Magdalene laundries Most girls come here pregnant,Joni Mitchell
Some by their own fathers,Joni Mitchell
We're trying to get things white as snow,Joni Mitchell
All of us woe-begotten-daughters,Joni Mitchell
In the streaming stains,Joni Mitchell
Of the Magdalene laundries Prostitutes and destitutes,Joni Mitchell
And temptresses like me,Joni Mitchell
Fallen women,Joni Mitchell
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery,Joni Mitchell
Why do they call this heartless place,Joni Mitchell
Our Lady of Charity?,Joni Mitchell
Oh charity! These bloodless brides of Jesus,Joni Mitchell
If they had just once glimpsed their groom,Joni Mitchell
Then they'd know and they'd drop the stones,Joni Mitchell
Concealed behind their rosaries,Joni Mitchell
They wilt the grass they walk upon,Joni Mitchell
They leech the light out of a room,Joni Mitchell
They'd like to drive us down the drain,Joni Mitchell
At the Magdalene laundries Peg O'Connell died today,Joni Mitchell
She was a cheeky girl,Joni Mitchell
A flirt,Joni Mitchell
They just stuffed her in a hole!,Joni Mitchell
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!,Joni Mitchell
One day I'm going to die here too,Joni Mitchell
And they'll plant me in the dirt,Joni Mitchell
Like some lame bulb,Joni Mitchell
That never blooms come any spring,Joni Mitchell
Not any spring Up in a sterilized room,Joni Mitchell
Where they let you be lazy,Joni Mitchell
Knowing your attitude's all wrong,Joni Mitchell
And you got to change,Joni Mitchell
And that's not easy,Joni Mitchell
Dragon shining with all values known,Joni Mitchell
Dazzling you keeping you from your own,Joni Mitchell
Where is the lion in you to defy him,Joni Mitchell
When you're this weak,Joni Mitchell
And this spacey So what are you going to do about it,Joni Mitchell
You can't live life and you can't leave it,Joni Mitchell
Advice and religion you can't take it,Joni Mitchell
You can't seem to believe it,Joni Mitchell
The peacock is afraid to parade,Joni Mitchell
You're under the thumb of the maid,Joni Mitchell
You really can't give love in this condition,Joni Mitchell
Still you know how you need it They open and close you,Joni Mitchell
Then they talk like they know you,Joni Mitchell
They don't know you,Joni Mitchell
They're friends and they're foes too,Joni Mitchell
Trouble child,Joni Mitchell
Breaking like the waves at Malibu So why does it come as such a shock?,Joni Mitchell
To know you really have no one,Joni Mitchell
Only a river of changing faces,Joni Mitchell
Looking for an ocean,Joni Mitchell
They trickle through your leaky plans,Joni Mitchell
Another dream over the dam,Joni Mitchell
And you're lying in some room,Joni Mitchell
Feeling like your right to be human,Joni Mitchell
Is going over too,Joni Mitchell
Well some are going to knock you,Joni Mitchell
And some'll try to clock you,Joni Mitchell
You know it's really hard,Joni Mitchell
To talk sense to you,Joni Mitchell
Trouble child,Joni Mitchell
Breaking like the waves at Malibu Play little david,Joni Mitchell
Play little david play David he would sit in some dark corner,Joni Mitchell
Seemed to melt the shadows with his eyes,Joni Mitchell
And the song that he was playing,Joni Mitchell
Was nothing less than prayin',Joni Mitchell
And nothing more than sayin' i'm alive.,Joni Mitchell
Won't you play little david,Joni Mitchell
Play little david play David he would send them notes a-flyin',Joni Mitchell
Some that laughed and some that felt like tears,Joni Mitchell
He would play them fast or slowly,Joni Mitchell
Play them high or lowly,Joni Mitchell
But they always come out holy to my ear,Joni Mitchell
Won't you play little david play little david play I don't need no sunday sermon,Joni Mitchell
Need no sunday shoes,Joni Mitchell
When I hear little david playing,Joni Mitchell
I got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin',Joni Mitchell
Some that laughed and some that felt like tears,Joni Mitchell
He would play them fast or slowly,Joni Mitchell
Play them high or lowly,Joni Mitchell
But they always come out holy to my ear,Joni Mitchell
Won't you play little david play little david play I don't need no sunday sermon,Joni Mitchell
Need no sunday shoes,Joni Mitchell
When I hear little david playing,Joni Mitchell
I got religion through and through David he would send them notes a-flyin',Joni Mitchell
Some that laughed and some that felt like tears,Joni Mitchell
He would play them fast or slowly,Joni Mitchell
Play them high or lowly,Joni Mitchell
But they always come out holy to my ear Won't you play little david play little david play,Joni Mitchell
Won't you play little david play little david play I had a king in a tenement castle,Joni Mitchell
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown,Joni Mitchell
He's taken the curtains down,Joni Mitchell
He's swept with the broom of contempt,Joni Mitchell
And the rooms have an empty ring,Joni Mitchell
He's cleaned with the tears,Joni Mitchell
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting- ,Joni Mitchell
I can't go back there anymore,Joni Mitchell
You know my keys won't fit the door,Joni Mitchell
You know my thoughts don't fit the man,Joni Mitchell
They never can they never can I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley,Joni Mitchell
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind,Joni Mitchell
He lives in another time,Joni Mitchell
Ladies in gingham still blush,Joni Mitchell
While he sings them of wars and wine,Joni Mitchell
But I in my leather and lace,Joni Mitchell
I can never become that kind  I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage,Joni Mitchell
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon,Joni Mitchell
Beware of the power of moons,Joni Mitchell
There's no one to blame,Joni Mitchell
No there's no one to name as a traitor here,Joni Mitchell
The king's on the road,Joni Mitchell
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year-  Who has seen the wind,Joni Mitchell
Scalloping the sea,Joni Mitchell
Or gliding like a swallow,Joni Mitchell
Over villages and trees? I have said the willow,Joni Mitchell
And I begged him please to stay,Joni Mitchell
But he went away,Joni Mitchell
He went on his own one day And I sing One love have I,Joni Mitchell
And he sings Now it's goodbye,Joni Mitchell
Through a parasol of leaves,Joni Mitchell
Through scattered ruby cloud fires,Joni Mitchell
Through the silver wings of bees I have said the waters,Joni Mitchell
And I held his face to mine,Joni Mitchell
But he left in time,Joni Mitchell
He went in his own good time Who has seen the stranger,Joni Mitchell
In a coat of simple brown,Joni Mitchell
With his face of many faces,Joni Mitchell
With his eyes turned out of town I have and I kissed him,Joni Mitchell
And I begged him please to stay,Joni Mitchell
But he went away,Joni Mitchell
With the sun and the wind away Where to begin to end uncertainty,Joni Mitchell
Do I leave silently or boldly say farewell,Joni Mitchell
How can I think of times that used to be,Joni Mitchell
And find the smile I need to wish you well But I won't cry for dusty memories,Joni Mitchell
No I won't cry for dreams that couldn't be,Joni Mitchell
No I won't cry The daffodils the sorry candlelight,Joni Mitchell
To buy my heart when loveless words were spoken,Joni Mitchell
Too many tears to welcome in the night,Joni Mitchell
Too many promises the days have broken So I won't cry for kisses out of reach,Joni Mitchell
No I won't cry Ill practice what I preach,Joni Mitchell
And I won't cry No flowers now no silly candle games,Joni Mitchell
Somehow my feet won't lead me to the doorway,Joni Mitchell
And so I stand and wonder who's to blame,Joni Mitchell
Waiting for one last word that calls to beg me stay But I won't cry if that world never comes,Joni Mitchell
No I won't cry for now the story's done,Joni Mitchell
And I won't cry goodbye Cold blue steel out of money,Joni Mitchell
One eye for the beat police,Joni Mitchell
Sweet fire calling,Joni Mitchell
Underneath the jungle gym,Joni Mitchell
Hollow-grey-fire-escape-thief,Joni Mitchell
Looking for sweet fire,Joni Mitchell
Shadow of Lady Release,Joni Mitchell
Edgy-black cracks of the sky,Joni Mitchell
Money cold shadows reply,Joni Mitchell
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked,Joni Mitchell
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas,Joni Mitchell
Sparks fly up from sweet fire,Joni Mitchell
Black soot of Lady Release,Joni Mitchell
Fever and the scum brown bowl,Joni Mitchell
Blue Steel still begging,Joni Mitchell
But it's indistinct,Joni Mitchell
Someone's hi-fi drumming Jelly Roll,Joni Mitchell
Concrete concentration camp,Joni Mitchell
Bashing in veins for peace,Joni Mitchell
Cold blue steel and sweet fire,Joni Mitchell
Fall into Lady Release,Joni Mitchell
Come with me I know the way she says,Joni Mitchell
My darling dime store thief,Joni Mitchell
In the War of Independence,Joni Mitchell
Rock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory,Joni Mitchell
Under neon signs,Joni Mitchell
A girl was in bloom,Joni Mitchell
And a woman was fading,Joni Mitchell
In a suburban room,Joni Mitchell
I said Take me to the dance,Joni Mitchell
Do you want to dance?,Joni Mitchell
I love to dance,Joni Mitchell
And we were rolling rolling rock n' rolling Downtown,Joni Mitchell
The dance halls and cafes,Joni Mitchell
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart,Joni Mitchell
Just doing the latest dance craze,Joni Mitchell
Gail and Louise,Joni Mitchell
In those push-up brassieres,Joni Mitchell
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings,Joni Mitchell
Drinking up the band's beers,Joni Mitchell
Kissing in cars kissing in cafes,Joni Mitchell
And we were walking down Main Street,Joni Mitchell
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays,Joni Mitchell
In France they kiss on Main Street,Joni Mitchell
Amour mama not cheap display,Joni Mitchell
And we were rolling rolling rock n' rolling Downtown,Joni Mitchell
In the pinball arcade,Joni Mitchell
With his head full of pool hall pitches,Joni Mitchell
And songs from the hit parade,Joni Mitchell
He'd be singing Bye Bye Love,Joni Mitchell
While he's racking up his free play,Joni Mitchell
Let those rock 'n roll choir boys,Joni Mitchell
Come and carry us away,Joni Mitchell
Sometimes Chickie had the car,Joni Mitchell
Or Ron had a car,Joni Mitchell
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head,Joni Mitchell
We'd all go looking for a party,Joni Mitchell
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead,Joni Mitchell
And I'd be kissing in the back seat,Joni Mitchell
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said,Joni Mitchell
And we'd be rolling rolling rock n' rolling He bought her a diamond for her throat,Joni Mitchell
He put her in a ranch house on a hill,Joni Mitchell
She could see the valley barbecues,Joni Mitchell
From her window sill,Joni Mitchell
See the blue pools in the squinting sun,Joni Mitchell
Hear the hissing of summer lawns He put up a barbed wire fence,Joni Mitchell
To keep out the unknown,Joni Mitchell
And on every metal thorn,Joni Mitchell
Just a little blood of his own,Joni Mitchell
She patrols that fence of his,Joni Mitchell
To a Latin drum,Joni Mitchell
And the hissing of summer lawns,Joni Mitchell
Darkness,Joni Mitchell
Wonder makes it easy,Joni Mitchell
Darkness,Joni Mitchell
With a joyful mask,Joni Mitchell
Darkness,Joni Mitchell
Tube's gone darkness darkness darkness,Joni Mitchell
No color no contrast A diamond dog,Joni Mitchell
Carrying a cup and a cane,Joni Mitchell
Looking through a double glass,Joni Mitchell
Looking at too much pride and too much shame,Joni Mitchell
There's a black fly buzzing,Joni Mitchell
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice,Joni Mitchell
Hissing summer lawns He gave her his darkness to regret,Joni Mitchell
And good reason to quit him,Joni Mitchell
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale,Joni Mitchell
That nobody sits in,Joni Mitchell
Still she stays with a love of some kind,Joni Mitchell
It's the lady's choice,Joni Mitchell
The hissing of summer lawns There's a crow flying,Joni Mitchell
Black and ragged,Joni Mitchell
Tree to tree,Joni Mitchell
He's black as the highway that's leading me,Joni Mitchell
Now he's diving down,Joni Mitchell
To pick up on something shiny,Joni Mitchell
I feel like that black crow,Joni Mitchell
Flying,Joni Mitchell
In a blue sky I took a ferry to the highway,Joni Mitchell
Then I drove to a pontoon plane,Joni Mitchell
I took a plane to a taxi,Joni Mitchell
And a taxi to a train,Joni Mitchell
I've been traveling so long,Joni Mitchell
How's I ever going to know my home,Joni Mitchell
When I see it again,Joni Mitchell
I'm like a black crow flying,Joni Mitchell
In a blue blue sky In search of love and music,Joni Mitchell
My whole life has been,Joni Mitchell
Illumination,Joni Mitchell
Corruption,Joni Mitchell
And diving diving diving diving.,Joni Mitchell
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing,Joni Mitchell
Just like that black crow flying,Joni Mitchell
In a blue sky I looked at the morning,Joni Mitchell
After being up all night,Joni Mitchell
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light,Joni Mitchell
I looked out the window,Joni Mitchell
And I saw that ragged soul take flight,Joni Mitchell
I saw a back crow flying,Joni Mitchell
In a blue sky,Joni Mitchell
Oh I'm like a black crow flying,Joni Mitchell
In a blue sky I'm always running behind the time,Joni Mitchell
Just like this train,Joni Mitchell
Shaking into town,Joni Mitchell
With the brakes complaining I used to count lovers like railroad cars,Joni Mitchell
I counted them on my side,Joni Mitchell
Lately I don't count on nothing,Joni Mitchell
I just let things slide The station master's shuffling cards,Joni Mitchell
Boxcars are banging in the yards,Joni Mitchell
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy,Joni Mitchell
If you can't find your goodness,Joni Mitchell
'Cause you lost your heart I went looking for a cause,Joni Mitchell
Or a strong cat without claws,Joni Mitchell
Or any reason to resume,Joni Mitchell
And I found this empty seat,Joni Mitchell
Old man sleeping on his bags,Joni Mitchell
Women with that teased up kind of hair,Joni Mitchell
Kids with the jitters in their legs,Joni Mitchell
And those wide wide open stares,Joni Mitchell
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars,Joni Mitchell
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar,Joni Mitchell
Jealous lovin'll make you crazy,Joni Mitchell
If you can't find your goodness,Joni Mitchell
'Cause you've lost your heart What are you going to do now,Joni Mitchell
You've got no one,Joni Mitchell
To give your love too Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind,Joni Mitchell
I've got this fold up sink,Joni Mitchell
And these rocks and these cactus going by,Joni Mitchell
And a bottle of German wine to drink,Joni Mitchell
Settle down into the clickety-clack,Joni Mitchell
With the clouds and the stars to read,Joni Mitchell
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm going to have,Joni Mitchell
Watching your hairline recede my vain darling,Joni Mitchell
Watching your hair and clouds and stars,Joni Mitchell
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car,Joni Mitchell
This jealous lovin's bound to make me,Joni Mitchell
Crazy,Joni Mitchell
I can't find my goodness,Joni Mitchell
I lost my heart,Joni Mitchell
Oh sour grapes,Joni Mitchell
Because I lost my heart Down in the cellar in the Boho zone,Joni Mitchell
I went looking for some sweet inspiration oh well,Joni Mitchell
Just another hard-time band,Joni Mitchell
With Negro affectations,Joni Mitchell
I was a hopeful in rooms like this,Joni Mitchell
When I was working cheap,Joni Mitchell
It's an old romance-the Boho dance,Joni Mitchell
It hasn't gone to sleep But even on the scuffle,Joni Mitchell
The cleaner's press was in my jeans,Joni Mitchell
And any eye for detail,Joni Mitchell
Caught a little lace along the seams And you were in the parking lot,Joni Mitchell
Subterranean by your own design,Joni Mitchell
The virtue of your style inscribed,Joni Mitchell
On your contempt for mine,Joni Mitchell
Jesus was a beggar he was rich in grace,Joni Mitchell
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory,Joni Mitchell
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance,Joni Mitchell
Have a fascination for me A camera pans the cocktail hour,Joni Mitchell
Behind a blind of potted palms,Joni Mitchell
And finds a lady in a Paris dress,Joni Mitchell
With runs in her nylons You read those books where luxury,Joni Mitchell
Comes as a guest to take a slave,Joni Mitchell
Books where artists in noble poverty,Joni Mitchell
Go like virgins to the grave,Joni Mitchell
Don't you get sensitive on me,Joni Mitchell
'Cause I know you're just too proud,Joni Mitchell
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now,Joni Mitchell
Even if good fortune allowed Like a priest with a pornographic watch,Joni Mitchell
Looking and longing on the sly,Joni Mitchell
Sure it's stricken from your uniform,Joni Mitchell
But you can't get it out of your eyes Nothing is capsulized in me,Joni Mitchell
On either side of town,Joni Mitchell
The streets were never really mine,Joni Mitchell
Not mine these glamour gowns I stepped outside to breathe the air,Joni Mitchell
And stare up at the stars,Joni Mitchell
Big dipper hanging there,Joni Mitchell
Over the rented car,Joni Mitchell
Over the rented car,Joni Mitchell
I'm a runaway from the record biz,Joni Mitchell
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids,Joni Mitchell
Boring!,Joni Mitchell
The old man is snoring,Joni Mitchell
And I'm taming the tiger,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
Nice kitty kitty,Joni Mitchell
Purring at your side,Joni Mitchell
Accolades and honors,Joni Mitchell
One false move and you're a goner,Joni Mitchell
Boring!,Joni Mitchell
The old man is snoring,Joni Mitchell
And I'm taming the tiger,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
Nice kitty kitty,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
In the forest of the night The moon shed light,Joni Mitchell
On my hopeless plight,Joni Mitchell
As the radio blared so bland,Joni Mitchell
Every disc a poker chip,Joni Mitchell
Every song just a one night stand,Joni Mitchell
Formula music girly guile,Joni Mitchell
Genuine junk food for juveniles,Joni Mitchell
Up and down the dial,Joni Mitchell
Mercenary style I watched the stars chuck down their spears,Joni Mitchell
And a plane went blinking by,Joni Mitchell
And I thought of Anna,Joni Mitchell
Wild and dear,Joni Mitchell
Like fireworks in the sky,Joni Mitchell
Fireworks in the sky,Joni Mitchell
I'm so sick of this game,Joni Mitchell
It's hip it's hot,Joni Mitchell
Life's too short the whole thing's gotten,Joni Mitchell
Boring!,Joni Mitchell
The old man is snoring,Joni Mitchell
And I'm taming the tiger,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
Nice kitty kitty,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
Oh be nice kitty kitty,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
Nice kitty kitty,Joni Mitchell
Tiger tiger burning bright,Joni Mitchell
In the forest of the night I've got a blue motel room,Joni Mitchell
With a blue bedspread,Joni Mitchell
I've got the blues inside and outside my head,Joni Mitchell
Will you still love me,Joni Mitchell
When I call you up when I'm down,Joni Mitchell
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain,Joni Mitchell
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane,Joni Mitchell
Will you still love me,Joni Mitchell
When I call you up when I get back to town,Joni Mitchell
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on,Joni Mitchell
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm,Joni Mitchell
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles,Joni Mitchell
Honey tell them you've got germs,Joni Mitchell
I hope you'll be thinking of me,Joni Mitchell
Because I'll be thinking of you,Joni Mitchell
While I'm traveling home alone,Joni Mitchell
Tell those girls that you've got Joni,Joni Mitchell
She's coming back home I've got road maps,Joni Mitchell
From two dozen states,Joni Mitchell
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate,Joni Mitchell
Will you still love me,Joni Mitchell
When I get back to town,Joni Mitchell
It's funny how these old feelings hang around,Joni Mitchell
You think they're gone,Joni Mitchell
No no,Joni Mitchell
They just go underground,Joni Mitchell
Will you still love me,Joni Mitchell
When I get back to L.A. town,Joni Mitchell
You and me we're like America and Russia,Joni Mitchell
We're always keeping score,Joni Mitchell
We're always balancing the power,Joni Mitchell
And that can get to be a cold cold war,Joni Mitchell
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk,Joni Mitchell
In some neutral cafe,Joni Mitchell
You lay down your sneaking round the town honey,Joni Mitchell
And I'll lay down the highway I've got a blue motel room,Joni Mitchell
With a blue bedspread,Joni Mitchell
I've got the blues inside and outside my head,Joni Mitchell
Will you still love me,Joni Mitchell
When I get back to town Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions,Joni Mitchell
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor,Joni Mitchell
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where,Joni Mitchell
Never mind their questions there's no answer for,Joni Mitchell
The roll of the harbor wake,Joni Mitchell
The songs that the rigging makes,Joni Mitchell
The taste of the spray he takes,Joni Mitchell
And he learns to give,Joni Mitchell
He aches and he learns to live,Joni Mitchell
He stakes all his silver,Joni Mitchell
On a promise to be free,Joni Mitchell
Mermaids live in colonies,Joni Mitchell
All his sea dreams come to me City satins left at home I will not need them,Joni Mitchell
I believe him when he tells of loving me,Joni Mitchell
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you,Joni Mitchell
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me,Joni Mitchell
Come down from the neon nights,Joni Mitchell
Come down from the tourist sights,Joni Mitchell
Run down till the rain delights you,Joni Mitchell
You do not hide,Joni Mitchell
Sunlight will renew your pride,Joni Mitchell
Skin white by skin golden,Joni Mitchell
Like a promise to be free,Joni Mitchell
Dolphins playing in the sea,Joni Mitchell
All his sea dreams come to me Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings,Joni Mitchell
I am smiling at your circles in the air,Joni Mitchell
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping,Joni Mitchell
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share,Joni Mitchell
A dream that you love someone,Joni Mitchell
A dream that the wars are done,Joni Mitchell
A dream that you tell no one but the gray sea,Joni Mitchell
They'll say that you're crazy,Joni Mitchell
And a dream of a baby,Joni Mitchell
Like a promise to be free,Joni Mitchell
Children laughing out to sea,Joni Mitchell
All his sea dreams come to me Through the windless wells of wonder,Joni Mitchell
By the throbbing light machine,Joni Mitchell
In a tea leaf trance or under,Joni Mitchell
Orders from the king and queen Songs to aging children come,Joni Mitchell
Aging children I am one People hurry by so quickly,Joni Mitchell
Don't they hear the melodies,Joni Mitchell
In the chiming and the clicking,Joni Mitchell
And the laughing harmonies Songs to aging children come,Joni Mitchell
Aging children I am one Some come dark and strange like dying,Joni Mitchell
Crows and ravens whistling,Joni Mitchell
Lines of weeping strings of crying,Joni Mitchell
So much said in listening Songs to aging children come,Joni Mitchell
Aging children I am one Does the moon play only silver,Joni Mitchell
When it strums the galaxy,Joni Mitchell
Dying roses will they will their,Joni Mitchell
Perfumed rhapsodies to me Songs to aging children come,Joni Mitchell
This is one She pulls the shade it's just another,Joni Mitchell
Sunny Sunday,Joni Mitchell
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois,Joni Mitchell
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday,Joni Mitchell
She waits for the night to fall,Joni Mitchell
Then she points a pistol through the door,Joni Mitchell
And she aims at the streetlight,Joni Mitchell
While the freeway hisses,Joni Mitchell
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor,Joni Mitchell
The streetlight's still burning,Joni Mitchell
She always misses,Joni Mitchell
But the day she hits,Joni Mitchell
That's the day she'll leave,Joni Mitchell
That one little victory that's all she needs,Joni Mitchell
She pulls the shade it's just another,Joni Mitchell
Sunny Monday,Joni Mitchell
She waits for the night to fall Out on some borderline,Joni Mitchell
Some mark of in between,Joni Mitchell
I lay down golden-in time,Joni Mitchell
And woke up vanishing Sweet bird you are,Joni Mitchell
Briefer than a falling star,Joni Mitchell
All these vain promises on beauty jars,Joni Mitchell
Somewhere with your wings on time,Joni Mitchell
You must be laughing,Joni Mitchell
Behind our eyes,Joni Mitchell
Calendars of our lives,Joni Mitchell
Circled with compromise,Joni Mitchell
Sweet bird of time and change,Joni Mitchell
You must be laughing,Joni Mitchell
Up on your feathers laughing Golden in time,Joni Mitchell
Cities under the sand,Joni Mitchell
Power ideals and beauty,Joni Mitchell
Fading in everyone's hand Give me some time,Joni Mitchell
I feel like I'm losing mine,Joni Mitchell
Out here on this horizon line,Joni Mitchell
With the earth spinning,Joni Mitchell
And the sky forever rushing,Joni Mitchell
No one knows,Joni Mitchell
They can never get that close,Joni Mitchell
Guesses at most,Joni Mitchell
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching,Joni Mitchell
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching,Joni Mitchell
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching Fly silly seabird,Joni Mitchell
No dreams can possess you,Joni Mitchell
No voices can blame you,Joni Mitchell
For sun on your wings,Joni Mitchell
My gentle relations,Joni Mitchell
Have names they must call me,Joni Mitchell
For loving the freedom,Joni Mitchell
Of all flying things,Joni Mitchell
My dreams with the seagulls fly,Joni Mitchell
Out of reach out of cry I came to the city,Joni Mitchell
And lived like old Crusoe,Joni Mitchell
On an island of noise,Joni Mitchell
In a cobblestone sea,Joni Mitchell
And the beaches were concrete,Joni Mitchell
And the stars paid a light bill,Joni Mitchell
And the blossoms hung false,Joni Mitchell
On their store window trees,Joni Mitchell
My dreams with the seagulls fly,Joni Mitchell
Out of reach out of cry Out of the city,Joni Mitchell
And down to the seaside,Joni Mitchell
To sun on my shoulders,Joni Mitchell
And wind in my hair,Joni Mitchell
But sandcastles crumble,Joni Mitchell
And hunger is human,Joni Mitchell
And humans are hungry,Joni Mitchell
For worlds they can't share,Joni Mitchell
My dreams with the seagulls fly,Joni Mitchell
Out of reach out of cry I call to a seagull,Joni Mitchell
Who dives to the waters,Joni Mitchell
And catches his silver-fine,Joni Mitchell
Dinner alone,Joni Mitchell
Crying where are the footprints,Joni Mitchell
That danced on these beaches,Joni Mitchell
And the hands that cast wishes,Joni Mitchell
That sunk like a stone,Joni Mitchell
My dreams with the seagulls fly,Joni Mitchell
Out of reach Out of cry Every picture has its shadows,Joni Mitchell
And it has some source of light,Joni Mitchell
Blindness blindness and sight,Joni Mitchell
The perils of benefactors,Joni Mitchell
The blessings of parasites,Joni Mitchell
Blindness blindness and sight,Joni Mitchell
Threatened by all things,Joni Mitchell
Devil of cruelty,Joni Mitchell
Drawn to all things,Joni Mitchell
Devil of delight,Joni Mitchell
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws,Joni Mitchell
Governing blindness blindness and sight Suntans in reservation dining rooms,Joni Mitchell
Pale miners in their lantern rays,Joni Mitchell
Night night and day,Joni Mitchell
Hostage smile on presidents,Joni Mitchell
Freedom scribbled in the subway,Joni Mitchell
It's like night night and day,Joni Mitchell
Threatened by all things,Joni Mitchell
God of cruelty,Joni Mitchell
Drawn to all things,Joni Mitchell
God of delight,Joni Mitchell
Mythical god of the everlasting laws,Joni Mitchell
Governing day day and night Critics of all expression,Joni Mitchell
Judges in black and white,Joni Mitchell
Saying it's wrong saying it's right,Joni Mitchell
Compelled by prescribed standards,Joni Mitchell
Or some ideals we fight,Joni Mitchell
For wrong wrong and right,Joni Mitchell
Threatened by all things,Joni Mitchell
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain,Joni Mitchell
Drawn to all things,Joni Mitchell
Man of delight-born again born again,Joni Mitchell
Man of the laws the ever-broken laws,Joni Mitchell
Governing wrong wrong and right,Joni Mitchell
Governing wrong wrong and right,Joni Mitchell
Wrong and right Twinkle twinkle what a pity,Joni Mitchell
All alone on such a pretty night,Joni Mitchell
With enchantment on your side Popcorn popcorn cotton candy,Joni Mitchell
I let him take me for a ride,Joni Mitchell
On a giant ferris wheel Up in the neon sky,Joni Mitchell
Or far from the barker's cry,Joni Mitchell
One kiss can sometimes,Joni Mitchell
Make you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel All the tents are taken down now,Joni Mitchell
All that's left is scuffled ground now,Joni Mitchell
Still the magic echoes in the sand Popcorn popcorn cotton candy,Joni Mitchell
Now a stranger takes my hand,Joni Mitchell
We smile and the magic understands Carnival in Kenora,Joni Mitchell
I let him take me for a ride,Joni Mitchell
On a giant Ferris wheel Up in the neon sky,Joni Mitchell
Or far from the barker's cry,Joni Mitchell
One kiss can sometimes,Joni Mitchell
Make you feel like a spinning Ferris wheel Out of the fire like Catholic saints,Joni Mitchell
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint,Joni Mitchell
Mimicking tenderness she sees,Joni Mitchell
In sentimental movies,Joni Mitchell
A celluloid rider comes to town,Joni Mitchell
Cinematic lovers sway,Joni Mitchell
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns,Joni Mitchell
Take her breath away Out in the wind in crinolines,Joni Mitchell
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn,Joni Mitchell
Through stand-in boys and extra players,Joni Mitchell
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair,Joni Mitchell
She comes from a school of southern charm,Joni Mitchell
She likes to have things her way,Joni Mitchell
Any man in the world holding out his arm,Joni Mitchell
Would soon be made to pay Friends have told her not so proud,Joni Mitchell
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling Not so loud!,Joni Mitchell
Lovers in anger Block of Ice,Joni Mitchell
Harder and harder just to be nice,Joni Mitchell
Given in the night to dark dreams,Joni Mitchell
From the dark things she feels,Joni Mitchell
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes,Joni Mitchell
Running from the reels Beauty and madness to be praised,Joni Mitchell
Cause it is not easy to be brave,Joni Mitchell
To walk around in so much need,Joni Mitchell
To carry the weight of all that greed,Joni Mitchell
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands,Joni Mitchell
Cast iron and frail,Joni Mitchell
With her impossibly gentle hands,Joni Mitchell
And her blood-red fingernails Out of the fire and still smoldering,Joni Mitchell
She says A woman must have everything,Joni Mitchell
Shades of Scarlett Conquering,Joni Mitchell
She says A woman must have everything Tomorrow is Sunday,Joni Mitchell
Now there's only one day left to go,Joni Mitchell
Till you walk by,Joni Mitchell
Below my window,Joni Mitchell
The weekends drive me mad,Joni Mitchell
Holidays are oh too sad,Joni Mitchell
'Cause you don't go,Joni Mitchell
Below my window No one knows I'm here,Joni Mitchell
One day I just disappeared,Joni Mitchell
And I took these two grey rooms up here,Joni Mitchell
With a view,Joni Mitchell
When you walk by,Joni Mitchell
Below my window You look so youthful,Joni Mitchell
Time has been untruthful,Joni Mitchell
Heaven knows I loved you,Joni Mitchell
30 years ago,Joni Mitchell
Hot days your shirt's undone,Joni Mitchell
Rainy days you run,Joni Mitchell
Oh and then you fade so fast,Joni Mitchell
Below my window No one knows I'm here,Joni Mitchell
One day I just disappeared,Joni Mitchell
And I took these two grey rooms up here,Joni Mitchell
With a view,Joni Mitchell
Only when you walk by,Joni Mitchell
Below my window,Joni Mitchell
When you walk by Below my window,Joni Mitchell
Below my window,Joni Mitchell
Hey hey,Joni Mitchell
Below my window,Joni Mitchell
Below my window,Joni Mitchell
Below my window Three waitresses all wearing,Joni Mitchell
Black diamond earrings,Joni Mitchell
Talking about zombies,Joni Mitchell
And Singapore slings,Joni Mitchell
No trouble in their faces,Joni Mitchell
Not one anxious voice,Joni Mitchell
None of the crazy you get,Joni Mitchell
From too much choice,Joni Mitchell
The thumb and the satchel,Joni Mitchell
Or the rented Rolls-Royce,Joni Mitchell
And you think she knows something,Joni Mitchell
By the second refill,Joni Mitchell
You think she's enlightened,Joni Mitchell
And she totals your bill,Joni Mitchell
They say Humble Makes Pure,Joni Mitchell
You're hoping it's near Folly,Joni Mitchell
'Cause you're headed that way for sure,Joni Mitchell
And you just have to laugh,Joni Mitchell
'Cause it's all so crazy,Joni Mitchell
Ah her mind's on her boyfriend,Joni Mitchell
And eggs over easy,Joni Mitchell
It's just a trick on you,Joni Mitchell
Her mirrors and your will,Joni Mitchell
So you ask the truck driver,Joni Mitchell
On the way to the till,Joni Mitchell
But he's just a slave,Joni Mitchell
To Barangrill The guy at the gas pumps,Joni Mitchell
He's got a lot of soul,Joni Mitchell
He sings Merry Christmas for you,Joni Mitchell
Just like Nat King Cole,Joni Mitchell
And he makes up his own tune,Joni Mitchell
Right on the spot,Joni Mitchell
About whitewalls and windshields,Joni Mitchell
And this job he's got,Joni Mitchell
And you want to get moving,Joni Mitchell
And you want to stay still,Joni Mitchell
But lost in the moment,Joni Mitchell
Some longing gets filled,Joni Mitchell
And you even forget to ask,Joni Mitchell
Hey where's Barangrill? Rousseau walks on trumpet paths,Joni Mitchell
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz,Joni Mitchell
Through I bars and girders-through wires and pipes,Joni Mitchell
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights,Joni Mitchell
Through huts through Harlem through jails and gospel pews,Joni Mitchell
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine,Joni Mitchell
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue,Joni Mitchell
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer,Joni Mitchell
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear,Joni Mitchell
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive,Joni Mitchell
They'll eat a working girl like her alive,Joni Mitchell
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand,Joni Mitchell
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines,Joni Mitchell
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band,Joni Mitchell
He hangs it up above the jungle line The jungle line the jungle line,Joni Mitchell
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time,Joni Mitchell
Floating drifting on the air-conditioned wind,Joni Mitchell
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in,Joni Mitchell
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke,Joni Mitchell
Coy and bitchy wild and fine,Joni Mitchell
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats,Joni Mitchell
Charging chanting down the jungle line There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb,Joni Mitchell
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room,Joni Mitchell
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet,Joni Mitchell
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit,Joni Mitchell
And metal skin and ivory birds,Joni Mitchell
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines,Joni Mitchell
Steaming steaming steaming up the jungle line It was a rainy night,Joni Mitchell
We took a taxi to your mother's home,Joni Mitchell
She went to Florida and left you,Joni Mitchell

I knew a girl named Nikki,Prince
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend,Prince
I met her in a hotel lobby,Prince
Masturbating with a magazine,Prince
She said how'd you like to waste some time,Prince
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind,Prince
She took me to her castle,Prince
And I just couldn't believe my eyes,Prince
She had so many devices,Prince
Everything that money could buy,Prince
She said sign your name on the dotted line,Prince
The lights went out,Prince
And Nikki started to grind,Prince
Nikki,Prince
The castle started spinning,Prince
Or maybe it was my brain,Prince
I can't tell you what she did to me,Prince
But my body will never be the same,Prince
Her lovin' will kick your behind,Prince
Oh she'll show you no mercy,Prince
But she'll sho'nuff sho'nuff show you how to grind,Prince
Darlin' Nikki,Prince
Woke up the next morning,Prince
Nikki wasn't there,Prince
I looked all over and all I found,Prince
Was a phone number on the stairs,Prince
It said thank you for a funky time,Prince
Call me up whenever you want to grind,Prince
Oh Nikki ohhhh,Prince
Come back Nikki come back,Prince
Your dirty little Prince,Prince
Wanna grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind,Prince
,Prince
Dig if you will the picture,Prince
Of you and I engaged in a kiss,Prince
The sweat of your body covers me,Prince
Can you my darling,Prince
Can you picture this?,Prince
Dream if you can a courtyard,Prince
An ocean of violets in bloom,Prince
Animals strike curious poses,Prince
They feel the heat,Prince
The heat between me and you,Prince
How can you just leave me standing?,Prince
Maybe I'm just too demanding,Prince
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold,Prince
Maybe you're just like my mother,Prince
Why do we scream at each other,Prince
This is what it sounds like,Prince
When doves cry,Prince

Always cry 4 love never cry 4 pain,Prince
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die,Prince
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized,Prince
No staring at his picture I realized,Prince
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried,Prince
Sometimes it snows in April,Prince
Sometimes I feel so bad,Prince
Sometimes sometimes I wish that life was never ending,Prince
And all good things they say never last,Prince
I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there,Prince
I know that he has found another friend,Prince
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow,Prince
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again,Prince
Sometimes it snows in April,Prince
Sometimes I feel so bad so bad,Prince
Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,Prince
But all good things they say never last,Prince
All good things that say never last,Prince
And love it isn't love until it's past,Prince
Oh yeah,Prince
In France a skinny man,Prince
Died of a big disease with a little name,Prince
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle,Prince
And soon she did the same,Prince
And their idea of fun,Prince
Is being in a gang called The Disciples,Prince
High on crack totin' a machine gun,Prince
Time time,Prince
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church,Prince
And killed everyone inside,Prince

And we're sending people 2 the moon,Prince
In September my cousin tried reefer 4 the very first time,Prince
Now he's doing horse it's June,Prince
Times times,Prince

When a rocket ship explodes,Prince
And everybody still wants 2 fly,Prince
Some say a man ain't happy,Prince
Unless a man truly dies,Prince
Oh why,Prince
Time time,Prince
Baby make a speech Star Wars fly,Prince
Neighbors just shine it on,Prince
But if a night falls and a bomb falls,Prince
Will anybody see the dawn,Prince
Time times,Prince

When a rocket blows,Prince
And everybody still wants 2 fly,Prince
Some say a man ain't happy truly,Prince
Until a man truly dies,Prince

Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade,Prince
She worked the night shift,Prince
Dishwater blonde tall and fine,Prince
She got a lot of tips,Prince
Well earlier I'd been talkin' stuff,Prince
In a violent room,Prince
Fighting with lovers past,Prince
I needed someone with a quicker wit than mine,Prince
Dorothy was fast,Prince
Dorothy laughed,Prince
She said Sounds like a real man 2 me,Prince
Kinda cute U wanna take a bath?,Prince
Cuz I'm kind of going with someone,Prince
She said Sounds like a real man 2 me,Prince
Mind if I turn on the radio?,Prince
Oh my favorite song she said,Prince
And it was Joni singing Help me I think I'm falling,Prince
The phone rang and she said,Prince
Whoever's calling can't be as cute as U,Prince
Right then I knew I was through,Prince
My pants where wet they came off,Prince
But she didn't see the movie,Prince
Cuz she hadn't read the book first,Prince
Instead she pretended she was blind,Prince
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse,Prince
I felt much better so I went back,Prince
Let me tell U what I did...,Prince
I took another bubble bath with my pants on,Prince
All the fighting stopped,Prince
Next time I'll do it sooner,Prince

2 greet the teacher Miss Cathleen,Prince
First was Kevin then came Lucy third in line was me,Prince
All of us where ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose,Prince
She always stood at the back of the line,Prince
A smile beneath her nose,Prince
Her favorite number was 20 and every single day,Prince
If U asked her what she had 4 breakfast,Prince
This is what she'd say,Prince
Starfish and coffee,Prince
Maple syrup and jam,Prince
Butterscotch clouds a tangerine,Prince
And a side order of ham,Prince
If U set your mind free baby,Prince

And it sure don't matter 2 night,Prince
Look here's a cool investment,Prince
They're tellin' him he just can't lose,Prince
So he goes off and tries to find a partner,Prince
All he finds are snakes in ever color,Prince
Every nationality and size,Prince
Seems like the only thing he can do,Prince
Is just roll his eyes and say that...,Prince
It sure didn't matter yesterday,Prince
Just when u think u've got more than enough,Prince
That's when it all up and flies away,Prince
That's when u find out that u're better off,Prince

So what if we're controllin' all the oil,Prince
If long life is what we all live 4,Prince
Then long life will come 2 pass,Prince
Anything is better than the picture of the child,Prince
In a cloud of gas,Prince
And u think u got it bad,Prince
Just when u think u've got more than enough,Prince
That's when u find out that u're better off,Prince
Cuz money didn't matter yesterday,Prince

In her hand she holds the very key,Prince
Words of compassion words of peace,Prince
But behold we will watch them fall,Prince
And we lay down on the sand of the sea,Prince
And before us animosity will stand and decree,Prince
That we speak not of love only blasphemy,Prince
And in the distance 6 others will curse me,Prince
All 7 and we'll watch them fall,Prince

Flesh of my flesh,Prince
If I don't think about the fact that she left me,Prince
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky,Prince
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy,Prince
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes,Prince
This is the best day of my life,Prince

I don't understand why u had 2 go,Prince
Just leave me,Prince
In the dark,Prince

So low the curb looks like a skyscraper,Prince
So high the stars are under me,Prince
So quiet I can hear the blood rushing through my veins,Prince
So low I feel like I'm going insane,Prince
The angels they watch in wonder,Prince
When U made love 2 me,Prince
Through the rain and the thunder,Prince
U cried in ecstacy,Prince
And U were so kind,Prince
I felt sorry 4 all creation,Prince
Because at the time no 1 was lucky,Prince
no 1 was lucky no 1 was lucky as me,Prince
And now U're gone and I just wanna be still,Prince
So silent I'll just let my senses sleep,Prince
It's gonna be so hard 2 hear my voice,Prince
If I ever learn once more 2 speak,Prince
I'm so lost no 1 can find me,Prince
And I've been looking 4 so long,Prince
But now I'm done,Prince
Ready or not here I come,Prince
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside,Prince
Never was a reason 2 let somebody know,Prince
Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows,Prince
Until now all I wanted 2 do is,Prince
Do do do what I do and,Prince
Bang bang bang on the drummer,Prince
Lay back and let the vibe just flow,Prince
Lay back and let my feelings show,Prince
I'm ready 4 the real,Prince
Give me something I can feel,Prince
All my life this heart's been under lock and key,Prince
My curtains were drawn there wasn't nobody home,Prince
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone,Prince
Until now all I wanted 2 do is,Prince
Do do do what I do and,Prince
Bang bang bang on the drummer,Prince
Lay back and let the vibe just flow,Prince
Lay back and let my feelings show,Prince
I I'm ready 4 the real,Prince
Give me something I can feel,Prince
4teen years and tears I've longed 2 sing my song,Prince
But a horse couldn't drag your ass 2 put me on,Prince
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong,Prince
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone,Prince
Until now all I wanted 2 do is,Prince
Do do do what I do and,Prince
Bang bang bang on the drummer,Prince
Lay back and let the vibe just flow,Prince
Lay back and let the feelings show,Prince
